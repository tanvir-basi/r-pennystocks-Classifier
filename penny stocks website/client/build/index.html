I decided that stock research on reddit should not be such a time consuming process.<br><br>I filtered the valuable posts by leveraging machine learning (supervised classification based on stock growths and text data) in order to help any busy user quickly filter out what they want to read.<br><br>I used r/pennystocks as the focus of this project because I think investors often illogically overlook these stocks due to the stigma that surrounds them and their reputation for being risky. However, many people tend to forget that many blue-chip companies we think of today were at one point classed as penny stocks.<br><br>Some notable examples: Apple in the early 2000s, Ford after both the financial crises and the 2020 stock market crash, Monster Beverage Corp until the late 2000s, Plug Power until 2020, and many more.</p></div></section><section class="my-work" id="work"><h2 class="section__title section__title--work">The Data</h2><p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--work">Stocks labelled 1 are meant to be good while posts labelled 0 probably are not</p><div id="root"></div></section><footer class="footer"><ul class="social-list"><li class="social-list__item"><a class="social-list__link" href="https://github.com/tanvir-basi/r-pennystocks_Classifier"><i class="fab fa-github"></i><p>2022 | Created by Tan</p></a><p></p></li></ul></footer><script src="js/index.js"></script></body></html>
