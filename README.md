## I. Abstract
Reddit has become a large source of financial information for many retail investors since the GameStop short squeeze. This activity has been mostly centered on r/WallStreetBets. We believe the subreddit r/pennystocks has been overlooked by retail investors, who unlike professional investors, have very limited time and resources to conduct their own research as they usually have a separate career. Therefore In this project we aim to solve 2 problems:
1. Bring awareness to other financial subreddits such as r/pennystocks
2. Save time by filtering out the memes, bad posts and ads.


## II. Introduction
The coronavirus pandemic has enticed a new wave of retail investors to try their hand in the stock market rather than leaving it financial professionals. This new breed of investor draws its information not only from mainstream news outlets but also reddit. Everyone is aware of the infamous r/WallStreetBets but one sub reddit which has been overlooked is r/pennystocks. This maybe due to the risk associated with pennystocks as they can be very volatile or a certain stigma which means retail investors never even look at stocks under $5. However many people tend to forget that many blue chip companies we think of today were at one point classed as penny stocks.

Here are some examples:
- Apple in the early 2000s
- Ford after both the financial crises and the 2020 stock market crash
- Monster Beverage Corp until the late 2000s
- Plug Power until 2020
- AMD until 2016

This was only one aspect of the problem, as r/WallStreetBets has a massive community that have multiple websites and youtube channels that analyse the subreddit for the best stock picks. This means that many retail investors can rely on these people to filter out the memes, bad posts and ads rather than wasting their own time. Since r/pennystocks has been overlooked unreasonably, it does not have the same community that can provide this time saving service. As a result, this project will aim to classify and filter which posts are worth to take a look at.
