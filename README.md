## I. Abstract

## II. Introduction
The coronavirus pandemic has enticed a new wave of retail investors to try their hand in the stock market rather than leaving it financial professionals. This new breed of investor draws its stock picks not only from mainstream news outlets but also reddit. Everyone is aware of the infamous WallStreetBets and the community has multiple websites and youtube channels that analyse the subreddit for the best stock picks. This means that many retail investors can rely on these people to filter out the memes and bad posts rather than wasting their own time. On the other hand, one sub reddit which has been over overlooked is r/pennystocks. This maybe due to the risk associated with pennystocks as they can be very volatile or a certain stigma which means retail investors never even look at stocks under $5. However many people tend to forget that many blue chip companies we think of today were at one point classed as penny stocks.

Here are some examples:
- Apple in the early 2000s
- Ford after the financial crises and the 2020 stock market crash
