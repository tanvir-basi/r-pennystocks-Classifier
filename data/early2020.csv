premiumpill	1578917856	"Hey, it's us again! As we once mentioned, we planned on taking a look at Antibe Therapeutics' lead drug ATB-346 and how sound the science behind it is. In addition we also analyzed available financial filings of past few years to see how well is the company doing from a financial perspective. 

Version with visual materials (pictures, graphs etc): [part 1 (science)](https://premium-pill.com/antibe-therapeutics-analysis-phase-2/) and [part 2 (financials)](https://premium-pill.com/antibe-therapeutics-onto-something-big-part-2/).

Hope we could be of service. :) 

 

**TLDR:** 

* **Antibe Therapeutics lead drug, ATB-346, seeks to be a more effective alternative for pain-relieving drugs;** 
* **The  science behind the current FDA trials is pretty sound. We expect Antibe  Therapeutics to successfully complete Phase 2B trials;**
* **The company is a typical R&amp;D pharmaceutical firm. They are very hungry for capital and churn through money very fast;** 
* **Nonetheless,  the financial situation in the last few years has been mostly stable.  They have proven their ability to find continuous additional capital for drug development**;

Tiny Canadian pharmaceutical company, Antibe Therapeutics, is  currently pushing through FDA trials to introduce a potentially  revolutionary new drug ‚Äì ATB-346. ATB-346 is an anti-inflammatory drug  and pain-relieving drug. It is also shown that unlike other similar  drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen), it does much less damage to stomach walls. 

In this article, we are going to provide an overview and our own  opinion on the chances of success for ATB-346 to succeed and whether one  should consider investing in Antibe Therapeutics to capture the  possible rise in stock price. For that, we will analyse and explain the  science behind ATB-346 and also look at the company‚Äôs financials.

# THE SCIENCE

# What is ATB-346?

ATB-346 is a naproxen-based molecule, that releases hydrogen sulphide  (H2S). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs (class of drugs  like ATB-346, ibuprofen, naproxen etc.) play a key role in relieving the  symptoms of osteoarthritis. As osteoarthritis is still a chronic  disease, people need to take the drug frequently ‚Äì even for many years.  This shows a great potential market for ATB-346. So far ibuprofen,  naproxen and other NSAIDs are ‚Äúdestroying stomach walls‚Äù on frequent  use. [Take a look at a picture](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png).

ATB-346 intends to protect stomach thanks to hydrogen sulphide (H2S).  Hydrogen sulphide and its gastroprotective effects are one of Antibes  lead scientists most researched subject. We could say that ATB-346 is a  spin-off or practical outlet for his previous research. Its H2S  gastroprotective (attached to naproxen) success is shown previously in  14-day phase 2 trial including 100+ patients. [The success was  outstanding with 94% of ulcer (‚Äúhole in the stomach wall‚Äù) incidence  reduction compared to naproxen itself](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-1.png). It also showed lesser overall  gastrointestinal side effects, which is just a bonus.

# Osteoa‚Ä¶ what?

Osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis that occurs when flexible  tissue at the ends of bones wears down (thank you google).  Osteoarthritis affects roughly 20-30 million people in the US ‚Äì this is  the potential maximum market in the US (according to various studies,  there are other countries in the world as well‚Ä¶). We‚Äôd like to bring out  two key factors affecting the progression of the disease: 

* **Obesity**. Heavy bodies increase the pressure on joints and worsen the osteoarthritis. As obesity [steadily rises](https://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/overweight_obesity/obesity_adults/en/) in the world, more osteoarthritis is likely to occur. 
* **Age**. As people age, there are biochemical changes in joints which may potentiate osteoarthritis. Even more importantly increasing age increases the risk of traumas, repetitive use of joints, infections, muscle weakness, etc., which all could increase the risk of osteoarthritis or worsen the disease. Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world‚Äôs population over 60 years will nearly [double from 12% to 22%](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health). 

People are getting fatter and older and it probably will increase the need for good pain killers to relieve osteoarthritis pain in the future. 

# About the phase 2B trial

**Quick info**[**\[1\]**](https://premium-pill.com/antibe-therapeutics-analysis-phase-2/#_ftn1)**:** 

* Began: 18.03.2019
* End of data collection: 29.12.2019 (estimated/pushed forward to Q1 2020)
* Disease: Osteoarthritis
* Testing: ATB-346 (150, 200, and 250 mg) for pain relief against a placebo
* Number of subjects: 360
* Age of subjects: 40-75 (both sexes)

The Phase 2B trial was estimated to end on December 29, 2019. It  began on March 18, 2019. The investigative period is 14 days with 10-day  follow-up for side effects, which is quite short, yet appropriate for  phase 2. But don‚Äôt expect the news now, because it seems, they are still  recruiting patients and after that, it takes time to finish the  analysis. They have officially said to release the results in Q1 2020.  As of the end of November, they had tested about 70% of required 360  test subjects.

# How likely is phase 2B trial going to be successful?

According to a previous study mentioned [here](https://premium-pill.com/clinical-trial-success-rates-for-investor/), this type of drugs (anti-inflammatory) success rates for phase 2 have been **45.7%**.  However, Antibe is conducting a trial for the lead indication  (osteoarthritis). The previous success rate for lead indication in this  group of drugs has been **48.7%**.

There is good evidence that this drug is effective for protecting the  stomach walls. Now they intend to further prove the pain-relieving  effect of the drug. **Antibe has previously successfully proved the effect of ATB-346 against naproxen on 12 patients**. This time they are recruiting a total of **360 patients**  and comparing it to placebo. Note that it is easier to prove efficacy  against a placebo than a comparator drug. Against placebo, the drug must  have at least some effect. Against comparator drug, it must be at least  as effective as the already working drug. And on 12 patients in the  previous trial, it was already as effective as naproxen. So, this the  first reason why this trial should succeed.¬† 

[In the red is marked the molecule of naproxen](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-3.png). If it gets released from the other part of the molecule, it should act as naproxen we already know and use today. Meaning, that we already know the potential benefits and side effects of one part of this drug. **More importantly, we know that the part under investigation (naproxen part), is already effective in relieving pain**, which the trial intends to prove. Also, releasing the naproxen part from the whole molecule might not even be necessary, as the naproxen part could effectively bind to receptors even with its added ‚Äútail‚Äù and still produce an effect. This is the second reason why this trial should succeed. 

The investigative period is 14 days + 10 days follow up for possible  side effects. Meaning it is enough to evaluate short term (2 weeks) pain  relief, but too short to expose long term side effects. Not exposing  side-effects is good for this specific trial to succeed. In the long  term however, they must prove the long-term safety as well as increase  number of patients for the trial. 

# We find that this trial has a high chance of succeeding because:

* **It is easier to succeed versus a placebo:**   
It compares the pain-relieving effect to placebo, yet on 12 patients it  has shown to be as effective as a working pain-killer naproxen. In a [trial with 100+ patients](https://antibethera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Wallace-2019-Br-J-Pharmacol-ATB-346-Phase-2B-GI-Safety.pdf),  it inhibited thromboxane synthesis (responsible for pain via activation  of COX enzymes) the same amount as naproxen. It should do well against a  placebo.
* **Part of the drug is being used already:**   
‚ÄúNaproxen‚Äù part of the ATB-346 molecule is itself already well known  and effective in mild to moderate pain-relieving. Again, a reason why it  should do well against the placebo group.
* **Trial period is in favour of success:**   
Short trial period serves in the favour of proving pain-relieving efficacy without showing any long-term side effects, that might halt or kill the trial.

# What could go wrong in this trial? 

* Feeling of pain is subjective. Trials in larger groups of  patients could reveal that earlier studies could have been a fluke,  because of the subjective pain measurement.   
**Not to worry too much**: As explained above, it  currently shows to be as effective as already marketed drug naproxen.  Also, they are using a standardised pain measurement test WOMAC, which  should give as objective responses as possible and is used in most  trials investigating osteoarthritis pain. 
* 250 mg dose of ATB‚Äê346 contains approximately one-sixth the  amount of naproxen as the 550 mg, twice‚Äêdaily dose of naproxen. Usually  naproxen blood plasma levels are 40-70 mcg/ml, ATB-346 levels are at  14-17 mcg/ml. Rising the question of can it really produce a  pain-relieving effect?   
**Not to worry too much**: Antibe has shown in its trials that both ATB-346 and naproxen affect the main known pain biochemical pathway (COX inhibition via measuring thromboxane activity) equally. Meaning there is strong reason to believe that it relieves pain as well as naproxen.
* H2S has a wide range of other physiological functions (as with  all simpler molecules), which may in time, reveal many unwanted side  effects. Worse if these side effects happen during this trial and they  are severe enough to stop it.   
**Not to worry too much**: if there would have been  anything especially serious, the trial would have stopped already. Yet  they are still going and nearing the end. Even more, it actually showed  less potency for at least the usual naproxen side effects. Its trial  period (24 days for side effects) is really narrow to reveal long term  side effects. 
* They are having problems with recruiting the patients. [70% recruited as of 28.11.2019](https://antibethera.com/news/antibe-therapeutics-provides-corporate-update-and-reports-q2-2020-interim-financial-and-operating-results/).¬†  Recruitment went past the previous deadline, yet they have the largest  number of trial centres open in Canada.¬† This is mainly due to their  patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. They are looking for healthy  elderly patients with only osteoarthritis. How many of these kinds of  patients are there?   
**Not to worry too much**: It is common for phase 2  efficacy trials to not include patients with more diseases. It is easier  to analyse and prove efficacy with less intervening factors. Such as  dealing with side effects and the extra costs related to it. And that‚Äôs  what we want from this trial!  
* They run out of money. This is unlikely to happen as they have  enough money for the completion of Phase 2B trials and also they have  the capital to begin preparatory work on Phase 3.¬†

# Conclusion on the science

From purely the trial perspective, considering even the negative parts, we‚Äôd say the success rate is definitely more than **48,7%**. In fact, we would be really surprised if the Phase 2B trial actually fails because:

1. They are proving that **naproxen** part of ATB-346, that is already a marketed painkiller, relieves pain more than taking nothing (‚Äúplacebo aka sugar-pill‚Äù), **meaning it should be effective**;
2. They  already have data (100+ patients), that it does inhibit enzymes  responsible for the induction of pain (shown by the reduction of  thromboxane activity), **meaning it should be effective**;
3. Trial period is too short to reveal any long-term serious side effects to halt this particular phase 2 trial, **meaning it should be safe**;
4. Many  trials fail because they are not able to recruit enough patients or run  out of money. They have already recruited 70% of the 360 patients and  opened new centres, **meaning they should get enough patients**. So the only question remains ‚Äì how capable is the company financially?  

 

# THE NUMBERS

# Introduction 

Since Antibe Therapeutics is primarily an R&amp;D pharmaceutical  firm, its‚Äô financial metrics cannot be evaluated by normal standards.  Moreover, it would very difficult to provide a valuation of the company  since it would require one to make an assumption on the success of their  drug developments, marketability, prices, profit margins of said drugs.  All in all, let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äì the provided valuation would probably be  as accurate as the one you could read out from tea leaves or sheep  intestines using dark and mysterious rituals. 

One more thing: all the numbers below are expressed in Canadian dollars and 1 CAD¬† = 0,77 USD. 

Since we cannot possibly in good faith provide a valuation, we can  merely delve into the company‚Äôs corporate and financial documents and  seek for positive/negative signs. Those signs are for example amount of  cash and liabilities company, how leveraged (in debt) the company is,  are there any numbers that do not really add up and hint that something  might be shady and so on.¬†¬† 

Antibe Therapeutics is divided into two segments: **Antibe Therapeutics**, company for pharmaceutical development and its‚Äô subsidiary **Citagenix**, a marketer and distributor of regenerative medicines serving the dental and orthopaedic marketplaces. 

Note: sometimes the company‚Äôs fiscal year is different than the  calendar year. In Antibe for example, the fiscal year starts with the  first of April (jokes on you) and finishes on the 31st of March.

R&amp;D part of the business, Antibe, generates no revenue whatsoever  and solely focuses on drug development. Citagenix, on the other hand,  most likely generates over 10 million CAD of revenue in the fiscal year  2020. As of September 30, 2019, Citagenix had generated 5,030 million  CAD revenue, as opposed to 4,611 million CAD (**ca +9%**) at the same time in the year 2018. This shows a continuous growth trend. 

But as revenue grows, cost of sales and expenses also increase, which  has resulted in operating at a loss also for Citagenix. The management  has explained incurring losses¬† in the following way: *‚Äúdue to the  seasonal slowdown of the business during the summer months, competitive  pressures in Canada, the repositioning of the instrument business and  the ongoing expansion into the US and the consequent expense on  marketing and operational initiatives.‚Äù* 

The company management expects growth strategy in the U.S. to result  in improved profitability and growth in fiscal 2020. If the company is  going for growth in other markets, operating at a loss is nothing  special and should not scare anybody off. Moreover, it is not common  that small pharmaceutical firms have already operating segments driving  stable revenue. Thanks to Citagenix, Antibe Therapeutics has some more  room to maneuver thanks to additional generated cash flow as opposed to  companies focusing solely on the R&amp;D. 

# How is their expansion going?

Revenue by geographic region for the six months ended September 30, 2019, is as follows:

* Canada 54% **(-6%)**
* United States¬† 31% **(+6%)** 
* Europe¬† 4% **(+2%)** 
* Rest of World¬† 11% **(-2%)** 

They have increased their presence 6% in the last six months, leading  us to conclude that at least short term their plan seems to be working  and thus decreasing the single market risk.

**Some small observations**

* Citagenix (and well, Antibes as well since Citagenix is the only  revenue stream for the company) gross profit is moving up (3,549  million      CAD vs 3,375 million CAD annually **‚Äì ca +5%**)  in 2019. There is a reason to expect that gross profit for fiscal 2020  will be more than the year before as the half-year results show  improvements (1,975 million CAD in 2020 for the first half of the fiscal  year versus 1,812 million CAD for the first half of the fiscal 2019 ‚Äì **ca +8%**). [The gross profit margin seems to be hovering around 40% mark](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-7.png). The gross  profit margin shows how much money did the company make from sales  after deducting the cost of goods sold (for every 1 CAD, they earned ca  40 cents). With their expansion, it seems that the margin has largely  remained the same, which is a good thing and means that the company is  retaining its‚Äô previous pricing power. However, this does not take into  account the cost of selling and general costs etc, which currently  outweigh the gross profit (due to expansion into other markets) and make  the company actually lose money instead of profiting. 
* [Revenue is moving up (9,5 million CAD vs 8,5 million CAD ‚Äì ca +11%)](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8.png)**.**
* Expenses  are also going up (more than 50% if you compare the fiscal      2018 to  fiscal 2019!). This trend is continuous also in the fiscal 2020 as       the Phase 2 trials for ATB-346 are on-going and expensive. 
* Losses  are mounting (net loss increased from 4,990 million CAD in      first  six months of 2018 to 8,245 million CAD in 2019 ‚Äì ca **+65%**).  Losses are expected to further increase as Phase 3 trial for ATB-346  (if it passes Phase 2) will be even more expensive than Phase 2  (approximately 30 million CAD).  

# Shareholder equity

Antibe Therapeutics shareholder equity has a whopping deficit of -48  million CAD. This means that the company‚Äôs liabilities exceed its‚Äô  assets almost by 50 million CAD and should ATE.V go under, you will get  nothing but a lesson for the future on risk management. :)  

In this case, the negative equity is largely due to accumulated  historical losses. Once again, this can be expected from a small R&amp;D  pharmaceutical company but it shows how risky the financial situation  of the company is. 

[This squiggly line above shows very well how the company has to constantly recapitalize itself.](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-9.png) However, this is not a bad thing at all  since it would seem that currently the ATB-346 trials (and largely the  company overall) are funded through capital markets (by issuing  additional stock and warrants) and thus does not put the company in  danger of drowning in debt. This is great from the perspective of the  financial health of the company as the company does not need to pay back  the received funding. It puts company (as they state themselves) in a  dangerous position as it will need regular re-capitalization from the  market, which is not beneficial to exist shareholders because of the  dilution. It also means that in case of a recession, market crash or  change in investors‚Äô sentiment, the funding for trials can dry up really  quickly.

# Liabilities

Consolidated liabilities have risen from 7,378 million to 8,344 million ( ca **+13%**).  Most of the increase is actually from Citagenix part of the business  and liabilities and current (short term obligations, usually due to  within a year). Overall, the company has increased current liabilities  from 2,907 million CAD to 5,851 million CAD (more than **+100%**)  from March 31, 2019, to September 30, 2019. Out of 5,851 million, 3,537  million CAD is from payable accounts and accrued liabilities. Loans  take lesser, 2,143 million CAD of the total current liabilities. 

Accounts payable are in essence debts for already rendered services.  If you buy a phone but pay for it in the following 6 months, the cost of  the phone together with interest is the payable account. That does not  mean that the company has taken on a lot of debt but rather means that  the company has pushed the payment date of services/products to the  future. This is beneficial and recommendable action from a business  perspective because it allows you to maintain cash liquidity and thus  options to use capital in other more productive ways in the meantime.  Still, about a third of the current liabilities (and pretty much total  liabilities) is debt, which puts the company is a constant need to  service the loan. 

# How solvent is the company? 

One possible way to evaluate the company‚Äôs solvency is the ‚Äúacid  test‚Äù. In essence, you find the ratio between cash and current  liabilities. The recommended ratio for a ‚Äútypical‚Äù company is 1.1  (meaning that they have a bit more cash at hand than liabilities that  must be paid within a year). 

[Acid test shows us that for the majority of last year the company was  above 1](https://premium-pill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11.png). This means that there was no substantial risk of insolvency  due to current liabilities and this is perceived as a good thing. The  company has so far enough liquidity and a positive influx of capital to  continue with drug development and trials. 

# Cash

Due to recent share and warrant (warrant gives a right to buy half a share in this case) issuance, company raised in total 7,637 million CAD and the total end of the period cash in 30th of September is 8,292 million CAD as opposed to 3.162 million CAD the previous year. The share and warrant issuance provided enough runway to see ATB-346 trials to the end of Phase 2 and hopefully fund some of Phase 3. In the documentation to issue new shares and warrants, the company stated that in August that the remaining cost for the Phase 2B study is 3,83 million CAD, which is to be funded by cash on hand and proceeds of the offering. **This means that they definitely have capital to complete Phase 2B.** 

They projected that funds raised in August will last them until summer of 2020. This means that the funds are also meant to cover some of the costs related to Phase 3 trials and other pipeline projects. 

The company expects Phase 3 trials to costs approximately 30 million CAD and they expect to commence with the trials in mid-2020 (lasting about 2 years).

# Conclusion

Issues Antibe Therapeutics is facing are common for every small pharmaceutical or biotech company. In fact, they actually are in a more beneficial position comparatively since they also have a back-up source of revenue in name of Citagenix and they do not solely lie on the success of their lead drug, ATB-346. It must be stressed though, that company‚Äôs stock price is most likely correlated only to the performance of their on-going drug trials for ATB-346. This means that if the trials do not go as well as expected, the stock price will likely fall faster than a drunk guy trying to wear heels. 

As we stated above, we are not comfortable giving our own guess on how the stock price reacts. Please refer to our previous [article](https://premium-pill.com/investing-in-pharmaceutical-companies/) on the average performance of pharmaceutical stocks with on-going drug trials. We do think that the trial is likely to be a success and will boost the stock price. 

Though wealth management and capital markets advisory firm [Echelon has given stock price a target of 1.40 CAD](https://www.cantechletter.com/2019/12/antibe-therapeutics-is-a-junior-biotech-stock-with-promise-echelon/). Anyhow, should the trials go well, Antibe Therapeutics definitely has a big potential upside in stock price.

Thursday 1/9/2020 Sorrento ( SRNE ) Received its second buyout offer in 3 months. Previously valued at 3-5 dollars and rejected. Recent offer at $7. It was made public Friday, and the stock shot up and sits at just under $4.82 for the weekend.

SRNE has multiple products in different stages of clinical trials, with one product currently at market. They develop non-opioid pain solutions. The current environment in pain management is leaning towards non-opioid solutions.

They have a market cap of 783 million. 316 million of debt. High volatility, and high risk

I am long SRNE and own 6 x $2.50 calls. 2 dated 1/17/2020 and 4 dated 3/20/2020. I purchased them 11/26/2019 shortly after the first buyout offer, and am up 200%. I feel as if it could be a lucrative trading opportunity still, and I truly want everyone who reads this to make money and be happy.

Gab2506	1578494682	"Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 8, 2020) -  PreveCeutical Medical Inc. (CSE: PREV) (OTCQB: PRVCF) (FSE: 18H) (the ""Company"" or ""PreveCeutical""), announces that after successfully developing water-based cannabis extract-infused soluble gel formulations (the ""CBD Sol-gel Formulations"") (see news release dated July 9, 2019), the Company has now completed a preliminary safety evaluation (the ""Evaluation"") of selected CBD Sol-gel Formulations in freshly explanted human nasal mucosal tissue (ex vivo).

Over a five-day analysis period during the Evaluation, there was no elevation in ""clinically accepted"" biomarkers of tissue toxicity. These results would appear to indicate that the selected CBD Sol-gel Formulations that were tested have no acute toxic effects when applied to human nasal mucosal tissue.


As medical research into the effects of cannabinoid acids in modulating disease pathways progresses, it is expected that benefits of cannabinoid acids will emerge, and the Company will be well-positioned with its CBD Sol-gel Formulations.

PreveCeutical's President and Chief Science Officer, Dr. Mak Jawadekar stated, ""The results from the Evaluation indicating no acute toxic effects of the selected CBD Sol-gel Formulations on explanted human nasal mucosal tissue is a good finding, and give us confidence to conduct further proof of concept studies.""

The CBD Sol-gel Formulations, when used with the Company's customized soluble gel (""Sol-gel"") applicator device for direct nose-to-brain delivery (the ""Sol-gel Applicator""), is expected to target direct and prolonged delivery of cannabinoids to a patients' central nervous system.

Future repetitive evaluations are required of the Company's sol-gel drug delivery research and development program (the ""Sol-gel Program""), which may involve pre-clinical/clinical evaluation of the CBD Sol-gel Formulation.

TurtleFur007	1578487477	"Pretty violent pullback yesterday has put it on the SSR list for today (short sellers cannot dump into the bid). Moving averages look like their lining up to cross in bulls favor, and a look at the options chain shows puts were LOADED yesterday. 

Wildcards - what trump has to say this morning, and if tensions in the ME escalate further. Also, the thoughts of current shareholders (again, the only ones who can sell into the bid today).

This looks like the beginning of a possible uptrend, but based on fundamentals I‚Äôm probably only looking short term on this instead of a swing/ investment. BUT I think that will keeps bulls confidence. Curious what others thoughts are on this - do you think we could see a squeeze today if the overall market doesn‚Äôt dump?"

TheBazaarTrades	1578463029	"Due to the recent event of the US base getting attacked, the oil will most likely rise. I introduce you to LLEX's chart, yet another chart with not only just an outside bar but an outside bar with a hodl feeling. Behold: [https://ibb.co/r2bNZCt](https://ibb.co/r2bNZCt)

&amp;#x200B;

I had a DM asking me a better understanding of outside bar of trends. Another example can be found here: [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=llex](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=llex) In order for a successful continuation needing to occur is needing to break an all-time resistance, moving with the market, and most important, rally trend.  I love triangles, and a triangle like this is a rare treat not only in technicals, but the fact it's holding well; especially for options users &amp; cash account users. 

LLEX, currently on the intraday has support of 0.65 with a breakout point after hours of 0.77 (new support line). The past two days had the support of 0.77 but fell at the opening today. Has a weak put which is going to ending up backfiring towards the bears. My amounts of money' on LLEX over ZN any day, though ZN in my opinion, is just a shot in the dark lottery hype. Lastly, a very weak wall at $1, with soft volume today's opening, medium volume near closing, and extreme volume push near the losing of after hours. The EPS for LLEX shines positively out of most other energy penny stocks.  

As for HUSA, it tried, but didn't continue forth, leaving me to sell at 0.265 vs the 0.25 I bought last night, though any gains are better than no gains at all. Not a terrible call, but gonna express the obvious to the obvious, HUSA is okay to me personally, but not enough attention on the eyes due to its relationship between the past &amp; stockholders."

HarshTruth69	1578454124	"&amp;#x200B;

The app for practicing was Stock market trading sim app

I  bought $100K worth of INPX at .50 not too long after it turned down and  I was down -40 to 60k on it and I figured this might happen but I held  onto it because for some reason I thought it might go past 5.00 and it  did not long after I bought it

on the app I sold it at $6.81 so I'm at 1.3 Million starting from $100K

I've heard penny stocks are a scam or an easy way to lose all your investment

Can someone give me any advice because if that was a real $100k I would have just profited 1.2M

I get what I did was unusual and risky and it even seemed I had quickly lost half of my investment \[ 50k \] but I held onto it because I strongly expected it to go up in value and it did 

Are penny stocks scams? Or just very high risk high reward? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can I make money off penny stocks for real? I want to hit 10 million dollars and semi retire but I also have other plans to make much more then that but I want my first taste of financial freedom to be gained from investing in stocks 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a big fan of gambling and I tend to be a good gambler and get lucky

I also prefer high risk high reward

And I have a goal of 10 million dollars starting from 100k-1 million

I have a talent that can generate me enough to get that starting amount but it requires some degree of luck and a bit help in completing the other part of it

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm in love with the fact that things can happen so quickly that said I don't obsessively monitor the price very often I tend to buy on my app and check it whenever I feel like it which I know isn't good and I would change somethings if it was real money

I'm still very new and I want to become good  and hit my 10 million goal

If that was a real 100,000$ I would be at 1.3 million now and would be smart enough to back off and just earn interest from that and then keep reinvesting what I could afford to

I also have a talent that can be used to generate 100K or more but it requires some degree of luck and I have to be very creative in that moment..... I'm working on generating money now and debating if I should use 100k or 200k if I end up generating 200k 

Oh Also I like to minimize the type of stocks to few and am in some cases very willing to dump all my money in 1 stock which is actually what lead me to now having 1.3 Million starting from 100K buying INPX at .5 and selling at 6.81"	NEED HELP with this Penny stock question	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/elmwv7/need_help_with_this_penny_stock_question/

I like WRR.V, a gold exploration play located in Nevada, but the stock is on the canadian exchange. Last year around this time they released drilling results and stock went up 350%. Since then it hasnt done much but more drilling results are expected to come in soon so I bought in.

January 30, 2020 - TheNewswire - Vancouver, Canada - Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (the "" Company "" or "" Guyana Goldstrike "") (TSXV: GYA ) , ( OTC:GYNAF ) , ( FSE:1ZT ) is pleased to announce that the Company has selected drill targets at the Marudi Gold Project ("" Marudi "" or the ""Property"" , or the "" Project "") located in Guyana, South America.

The Company's 2018/19 trenching program successfully outlined a new mineralized area that continues for more than 1.75 kilometres along Toucan Ridge (see map below). Toucan Ridge is roughly one kilometre northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone which currently contains the Project's mineral resource estimate (please see "" Mineral Resource Estimate "" below).

A diamond drill program of up to 12 holes is planned and may be extended. The planned drill program will predominately focus on Toucan Ridge where a total of 2,458 metres of trenching was completed and 837 samples were taken.

Drill targets have been chosen from identified magnetic anomalies and gold assays from surface trenching and sampling of the quartzite-metachert host rock.

The specific drill locations will be in proximity to trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8, as priority targets, followed potentially by drilling trench areas TTR-18-9, TTR-18-11, TTR-18-12, and TTR-18-13.

In 2018, trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 assayed grades as high as 7.2 g/t Au over 3 metres.

The first drill pads will be positioned to drill angled holes across the area of trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 to an initial planned depth of 130 metres and a maximum depth of 200 metres.

In preparation for the next phase of exploration, the technical team has reviewed the legacy data, including drill assays, drill angles, collar location, grade and interval lengths from past drilling on the Property in order to further refine its exploration efforts at Marudi. The compilation of these historic drill assays will provide important information that the technical team will use to calibrate drilling on the Property.

The following assay highlights are from the Mazoa Hill Zone which is approximately one kilometre south west of the Toucan Ridge discovery area:

Assay Highlights of Sutton Resources Diamond Drill Programs 1991-94 - Mazoa Hill Zone:

* \- MR 91-068 - 6 metres of 29.97 g/t Au; within 72 metres of 5.11 g/t Au  
\- MR 91-074 - 15 metres of 15.30 g/t Au; within 75.00 metres of 4.60 g/t Au  
\- MR 94-102 - 52 metres of 4.06 g/t Au; within 190 metres of 2.39 g/t Au  
\- MR 94-113 - 36 metres of 7.74 g/t Au; within 141 metres of 3.31 g/t Au  
\- MR 94-115 - 45 metres of 10.82 g/t Au and 30 metres of 15.16 g/t Au; within 81 metres of 7.71 g/t Au  
\- MR 94-120 - 12 metres of 16.65 g/t Au; within 57 metres of 4.51 g/t Au

Please note: Interval lengths are not true widths.

Mineral Resource Estimates

The Mazoa Hill Zone contains the Company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggests that the mineralized zone is open in several directions including at depth.

* \- 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 g/t;  
\- 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 g/t

For further information concerning the Mazoa Hill Zone Resource Estimate, readers are encouraged to review "" Technical Report: Marudi Property Mazoa Hill Mineral Resource Estimate "", a technical report prepared for the Company by Global Mineral Resource Services and is available at: [GYA Mazoa Hill Zone 43-101 ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/images/pdf/43101_Report_Guyana_Goldstrike_Mazoa_Hill_Zone_Jan_2018.pdf), at the Company's website [www.guyanagoldstrike.com ](http://www.guyanagoldstrike.com/)and under the Company's profile on [www.sedar.com ](http://www.sedar.com/).

Readers are cautioned that although the Project has a mineral resource estimate and a mining license a production decision has not been reached by the Company in respect of the Project, nor has a feasibility study been completed to assess the economic viability of commercial production at the Project. Also note, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

The Company also announces that Frontier Flex Marketing (Frontier) continues to provide investor relations and marketing services to the Company. The agreement with Frontier commenced on January 2019, with remuneration of $7,000 per month. The services were put on hiatus for an extended period in 2019. The Company has re-commenced services as of January 2020. This was part of an extension and revision to an original agreement with Frontier Merchant Capital for similar investor relations and marketing services that was signed on January 2018, with remuneration of $5,000 per month. Frontier Merchant Capital were also granted 50,000 stock options of the Company at 25 cents in January 2018 and 150,000 stock options at 30 cents on October 30, 2018.

About Guyana Goldstrike Inc.

The Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project, which has a 17-year mining license and is located in Guyana, South America. Historic diamond drilling completed on the Project by prior operators have delineated two zones of gold mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. A mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Mazoa Hill Zone. Data analyzed suggests the zone is open to mineralization in multiple directions and at depth.

Through the recent exploration program, the Company has discovered a third mineralized zone, called Toucan Ridge, which is situated approximately 1000 metres to the northeast of the Mazoa Hill Zone. In addition to the known gold zones and the new Toucan Ridge zone, the Company has over 45 sq. kms of underexplored land and believes the greater land position has excellent upside potential for the discovery of new mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the Project.

About Guyana

The Republic of Guyana is located in South America adjacent to Suriname. The country is English speaking and its legal system is based on British common law with a democratically elected government. It has an established mining act and a rich history of gold production. The Fraser Institute's 2016 Annual Survey of Mining listed Guyana as the third best mining jurisdiction with regards to investment attractiveness in the Latin America and Caribbean Basin sub-group. The Guiana Shield is the geographic gold-hosting region and is world-recognized as a premier gold region that is highly prospective, under-explored and has geological continuity with West Africa. Barrick has recently announced that the Giuana Shield will be their priority region for discovery opportunities and early stage exploration.\* Exxon Recently announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels of offshore oil with production scheduled for first quarter of 2020. This discovery will designate Guyana as having the fastest growing GPD in 2020, estimated to be 86%.\*\*

For me, SNPW is one of the most undervalued among a few legit stocks on the OTC Market. Because The Company currently has 29 Million Dollars Capital and 627 million outstanding shares. If you divides $29 million Capital/ 627 million shares = .046 dollars capital per share.

Company working to file S-1 within 45 days

MELBOURNE, Florida, Jan. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Kona Gold Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: KGKG), a hemp and CBD lifestyle brand focused on product development in the functional beverage sector, is pleased to announce it has submitted its OTCQB application. The Company recently completed its 2017 and 2018 financial audit by its PCAOB auditor.

Kona Gold is to begin the audit on its 2019 financials next month. The Company is simultaneously working on its S-1, which it plans to have filed in the next 45 days. Once its S-1 has been filed, the Company will move from being an alternative reporting Company to a fully reporting Company with the SEC.

SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENTAd
""I am excited to announce to our shareholders that we have completed our 2017 and 2018 audit and filed our OTCQB application,"" stated Robert Clark, CEO of Kona Gold Solutions, Inc. ""The OTCQB approval process can take up to four weeks, but could happen earlier. We will also be posting our 2017 and 2018 audited financials within a week. We are scheduled to begin our 2019 audit next month and we are currently working through our S-1, which we plan to file within the next 45 days.""

Clark continued, ""We are taking the necessary steps to become a fully reporting public company, which will further separate us from other companies in our sector and garner national attention the Company deserves.""

Kona Gold recently had a second meeting with a large southeast supermarket chain. The Company is moving forward with partnering with that chain to sell its Kona Gold Hemp Energy Drinks across several states and will announce updates as they unfold."	Kona Gold Solutions, Inc.

**The Skinny**

* SURG shares are massively undervalued relative to recent and forward dependable growth rates.
* The company‚Äôs model is hitting an inflection that will spur up to 5000% topline growth over coming quarters as an exponential compounding process takes hold.
* The market has failed to appreciate this dynamic because it doesn‚Äôt understand the model.. but it will understand the numbers when they hit.

nomadtrader22	1579949970	"OK so everyday I'm faced with a choice of say 10K stocks, so I start with my scanner and look for the gappers. The gappers are random they need to be researched and a bias formed and a plan put together but the news (if it has any) whether it's a PR or an SEC filling may or may not be deceiving only the people who are very familiar with that stock will know or should know. Then you have chatroom pumpers and the Level 2 spoofers plus let's not forget the market makers.. and the companies themselves who may just be trying to raise funds with an offering on the shelf ready for unsuspecting punters, or not! maybe it looks bad but goes to the moon anyway who knows right? or it goes to the moon just because it's bad but turns into a short squeeze..  \\0/!

This is HARD work day in day out. Options or futures are still vulnerable to these shenanigans and different points of view because they are based on the underlying security. 

Now, when I said I may have a better idea I don't mean I actually invented it I should have said I see a better way IMHO. Trade just 500 of the worlds best companies or more precisely one ETF the $SPY - but indirectly. 

If your sole focus was the SPY then by definition your expertise on it would build up by the day instead of starting from zero each morning. Can the SPY be manipulated.. nah it does 300M in volume a day some times. But the SPY is expensive and some time does not move much which is why I say 'indirectly' the UVXY ETF is $12 and mirrors the SPY candle for candle but inverse and moves 3x the SPY great for when the SPY is having a pull back or the much predicted correction.. then there is the TQQQ ETF for longing the SPY on up days which is also 3x but one third the price at $100. I've never been a fan of indicators but have to say they seem to work better on the SPY the SPY is predictable or should I say more predictable than random stocks. Yea you can trade the SPY with options &amp; futures contracts or e-minis with their strike prices and 'Greeks' whatever that means, and they have limited liability but I'm just a simple day trader and I have hard stops I don't want to be boxed in by the CME Group.

Obviously I'm one of many to arrive at the same idea would love to hear from others who have tried it think it's bollocks or love it, or could refine it in some way have I missed a trick here?"

PNNX is planning to release details of their product [after the patent is submitted](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pennexx-foods-inc-pnnx-_we-are-now-current-and-looking-forward-to-activity-6622152732646129664-o0rO), but the product itself [next week](https://twitter.com/pennexx). No marketing or public announcment have been made in the news, apart from 3 LinkedIn posts, and a handful of Twitter posts. 

They [acquired](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/16/1930604/0/en/PNNX-Discloses-a-34-9-Million-NOL-and-Completes-Your-Social-Offers-Acquisition.html) Your Social Offers for $34Mil, which is basically an app for [targeted ads](https://www.wix.com/app-market/social-offers/overview), [Triple888Ligistics](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/23/1934198/0/en/PNNX-Acquires-Triple-888-s-Logistics-Inc-and-its-Intellectual-Property-Bit-Gift.html) that owns [bitcoin gift card company](https://twitter.com/giveabitgift) and hasn't been active in few years, and entered into partnership with [VistaMoney](https://vistamoney.com/) , who makes prepaid reloadable virtual cards. 

It does sound interesting and please do your own dd as well, but here are some of the risks and questions to consider: 

1) [Executive Team](http://www.pennexx.net/about.html#team) is questionable. [CMO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunny-sweet-66606a33/) for example is some lady from Florida, who used to own a company that made fur pillows out of your old fur coats. For a company that's launching cutting edge tech product might not be the best fit. 

2) Who is doing all the work? Based on my research I can only see 7 people working in Pennexx, Triple 888 logistics and VistaMoney combined. 

3) They might not end up making the product.

4) They might end up making the product, but noone is going to use it.

5) They end up making great product that everyone is using, but get shut down by Big Banks and the IRS immediately, because noone's gonna let this much money move around undocumented on prepaid cards.

I am new to the stock market. Right now I am using redditb of course, and my experience and knowledge in biology to decide on small but promising investments. 

Both of these companies I mentioned in the headline accomplished important steps recently, the first completing a second phase 3 trial for a new hep b vaccine, which may surpass the current gold standard vaccine in North America, planning to start distributing it by the mid of he year. The second has announced today that a lung cancer drug they developed was aproved by the FDA and might go through a fast track, and may be used to treat other cancers if I am not wrong. 

While buying is almost an easy decision, based on this information, when should I sell? I am following up daily in these companies now (atleast vibv) to see if there are any developments, but are there any speculation on the  best time to sell?

No let's say another company bids on the first company for 1 billion dollars. Would the SP typically rise to around $2 a share?

TheBazaarTrades	1579321669	"Happy Friday, all! 

Today, I introduce you to BIOC. One of which many penny stocks I wasn't fond of. Why does this interest me now than it did before? Quite a handful of reasons. On 3/26/19 I bought it at 1.25 and released it on 3/26/19 1.16 I wasn't comfortable there wasn't strong support and lacked continuation that I knew wouldn't keep going. Fast forward to 12/09/2019 I noticed a harsh knife drop; we all hate those. It reached a clear bottom stop at 0.22. Skeptical, but kept it on the watch. I could have bought at this position, however, I wanted to avoid the cup &amp; handle going downwards, not upwards. Assuming as such, it broke the pattern around 0.30 which in my opinion, is an unusual pattern than going downwards, but instead upwards.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been going up since 12/19/19 through 1/17/20. The pattern is coming to fruition for a continuation upwards out of the outside bar trend line, &amp; into something much much bigger. It's EPS has been doing well since 2016 down through 2018 (-57.63 through -9.01, impressive). Quite frankly, I am eager to see their earnings report this month. PE -0.12 which is incredibly reasonable to play with for a penny med stock, with a rating of one strong buy, and two buys. 

You'll find a reasonable point of interest support line continuing with a base support of 0.32, and stubborn resistance of 0.37 &amp; 0.40. Either, a strong rally needs to continue to break 0.36, and or followed by strong catalyst news to break 0.40. Terrifyingly, (assuming) if this so-called proclaimed buy out the rumor is coming into the light, the possibilities are endless. However, I would take the buy-out rumors with very little salt since GE refuses to comment on it and the rumor has been ongoing for years between BIOC  &amp; GE. But, I do believe a buy out is tangible whether it would be GE or other entities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Charting pattern: The bottom line, it's holding well and deserves a HODL opportunity. See bellow the image, and prove me wrong.

It‚Äôs no secret that penny stocks are a crap shoot. I‚Äôve had just as much success/failure in the stocks I‚Äôve heavily researched compared with those I‚Äôve picked at random. 



I‚Äôve decided that I want try put the small amount of money I‚Äôve made in penny stocks into an algorithm. The time I‚Äôve spent researching feels like a waste when then rando‚Äôs often do just as good. So why not let a machine go through the trouble? It could be as simple as having it invest $50 in the top five movers (under a dollar market value) and selling 3 hours later hours later whatever the outcome.

JayceNugent	1579222290	"AGRX - Agile Therapeutics Inc notes:

The company is cash strapped with only 18.37 million dollars on its last quarterly balance sheet. While its last years cash flow from operations was -16.89 million dollars. The company has been promoting itself a lot lately and has prepared itself for some investing trade shows in order to attract more investors.

My thesis is that the company needs to raise cash, which it will do by way of share dilution. Interestingly, potential revenue generating news has come out. All in all, the bet is in whether the news is planted to raise the stock price at an opportune time for the company at the expense of investors? Or that the recent price movement is a genuine price rally on new information? Only time will tell and I am short this stock.

My guess is a big player knew about the news item before it was released and immediately took profits. It has failed to gain traction since, but dang nabbit this great trial of drugs still happened!! Looking like it could go to like $12 eventually. Should rebound real soon though.

Wednesday, January 15, 2020, Draper, UT NRP Stone, Inc. Announces Amended Letter of Intent

The Company previously issued an Amended Letter of Intent for the acquisition of Rare Metals and Gems Investors, LLC (RMGI), which has been amended to address the recently received exclusive worldwide marketing agreement for white diamonds and added gold products. The Amended LOI was issued by NRP to RMGI on January 15, 2020 after the marketing agreement was received by RMGI. NRP has chosen a closing date of February 15, 2020.



The RMGI marketing agreement includes raw and finished white diamonds, as well as different gold products, including bullion, coins, nuggets, and jewelry. GIA-graded, colored diamonds in Luxium ring settings and GIA-graded, loose diamonds will be transferred to NRP in the transaction. One ton of Luxium ore concentrate has also been offered to NRP in the transaction. The ore was appraised by a third party in a Technical Assessment and Valuation Report dated August 30, 2019, being valued at $1.5MM per ton.



Once the RMGI transaction is closed, NRP expects to begin funding the company for the purpose of purchasing white diamonds and gold products for sale in NRP products. NRP will then directly negotiate R&amp;D, manufacturing, and marketing of Luxium products. Management also expects to seek joint manufacturing operations for colored diamonds. As previously reported, a fully integrated funding, manufacturing, and marketing strategy for a multiple-phased plan of manufacturing and marketing is being discussed. This has been expanded to include minting operations for gold coins, as well as diamond cutting and finishing operations.

RamzFanz	1581525944	"ONTX

I was swinging it for months so I haven't lost any money but I could have kept large profits and I didn't. It was a calculated risk that didn't pay off and not an emotional move, so I'm disappointed with the results, but not so much my choices. 

It was obviously a mistake expecting news at the conference but I still think it was a reasonable expectation and not FOMO. Even without news, I didn't expect a fall-back this hard, all things considered. I do think this is now oversold and will rebound some on its own.

Hopefully, with two more conferences and the filling of the P3 trial expected this month, it reverses and begins an upward trend so I can exit.

If I can get out at or near profit on this current trade, any time before May, I will. The P3 results aren't until June and there should be re-entries before then. Otherwise, I'm taking it up to P3 results.

OGEN

Another swing stock for me so I'm actually still up pretty nicely. I was so focused on the ONTX conference presentation, I missed my exit(s) on OGEN. I also didn't know OGEN presented so early in the day for some odd reason. Next time I'll use a stop-loss. Not sure why I didn't have one in place as I usually do other than distractions.

They present P2 results in late Q12020 so I'm staying in and will probably add if I get to exit ONTX soon.

There is a higher risk of further dilution than with ONTX so a lower entry may be in the works. Hopefully, they go through P2 without it.

I am sharing it to help you on your journey as well as this is one of my favorite pices of information I have ever found. It helped me to keep moving forward when I felt like giving up.

21. We go back into the market and continue to donate.We go back into the market and continue to donate.

22. We start to take responsibility for our trading results as we understand that our success is in us, not the methodology.

26. We go back and research our rules.

27. We build the confidence in our rules and go back into the market and trade.

28. Our trading results are getting better, but we are still hesitating in executing our rules.

29. We now see the importance of following our rules as we see the results of our trades when we don't follow them.

30. We begin to see that our lack of success is within us (a lack of discipline in following the rules because of some kind of fear) and we begin to work on knowing ourselves better.

31. We continue to trade and the market teaches us more and more about ourselves.

32. We master our methodology and trading rules.

33. We begin to consistently make money. We begin to consistently make money.

34. We get a little overconfident and the market humbles us.

35. We continue to learn our lessons.

OGEN and ONTX are both up around 40%-50% in 5 days!

Rumor has it, from a source I find reliable, OGEN is dropping news at the conference on Tuesday. Are you riding it out?

I'm riding OGEN into P2 results in 4-6 weeks and then re-evaluating.

I sold all of both stocks today on spikes and bought back into OGEN on a dip. *Big mistake?*

I've been waiting on a dip for ONTX but they robbed me! You ALWAYS dip ONTX!!

Still, $1,000 day is a $1,000 day!

HOLDING:
AGRX - 3.73 - Bouncing EMA13 holding trend

SKYS - 1.72( baby bag) RS pumps hot, 1.60s seems to be the new 1.40s for long holders in the alert

ACHV - .58(May sell next move to .60s) stay tuned

AIMT - 36.4 avg I have yet to avg down but I am comfortable holding, avg down target would be around EMA200 26.77. Will hold until 40.

Also watching RWLK and SLRX these may consolidate for a bit, waiting on bottom support to form but these two could be my next AEMD and VIVE holds for the run.

Swing entry alert: $APEX
This one is gearing up again, not sure when it will pop but it can happen any moment, techs looking ready. Immediate target .95. Preferred entry. 67 - .68 if you catch a dip. But .7-.72 are safe entry This may not be too long a swing but since it is not a momentum swing.

I got a referral from someone to get a free stock and after downloading my phone started acting super weird. They make you verify your phone number right, well about an hour afterwards I started getting some weird texts from people I don't. One of them was saying they were an old friend I haven't talked to in years, when I questioned how they got my number they said through my brother Jimmy and I don't have a brother Jimmy. It's not just the wrong number because they knew alot about me and where I lived. They kept asking questions trying to get information. It also kept randomly saving files in my folders on my phone in Chinese. And opening an closing by itself. I looked on app store under comments and it seems there are only 3, with one of them saying it's a app used for stealing information and spying. I wound up doing a factory reset on my phone and now they keep emailing me saying my deposits have been successful over and over and I haven't used the app since then I never even deposited. I even tried logging in again on the website thinking maybe they are somehow taking my money but I think I'm locked out or something nothing happens when I login.

They have a higher Net income than market cap, this is unheard of. They are already profitable, and have high guidance. They are buying back shares too, $10M worth, as a recent IPO!

I will highlight competitive advantages with brackets [].

So they run an algorithm that utilizes machine learning on [Chinese state owned computers]. They didn‚Äôt pay for the computing power but they own the algorithms. Their algorithms sort thru people to decide who to lend money to and who not to. So each person served improves the algorithm via machine learning.

Well they serve the [three largest telecom companies in China] and they are paid per facilitated loan.

If this was priced cheaply it would be worth $7. And that doesn‚Äôt take into account their future plans. They plan to expand into more broad loans and not just loans for telecommunication companies. They will be able to leverage their ever improving algorithms to gain even more companies that utilize their algorithms and that, in turn, will improve the algorithm even more.

I'm not a day trader so price action doesn't excite me. What really excites me are tangible assets and projected long-term returns on capital. I'm looking for prospects that have long-term partnerships and recurring revenues already in place. For example, a mining company with appropriate leverage, growth outlets, and an off-take agreement.

0. Find a stock

1. Buy 100,000 shares @ 0.01$ each. So $10K total.

2. Shill it. 

3. Sell it.

4. Repeat.

I've read some stuff like [this](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051415/risks-trading-lowvolume-stocks.asp). So I have a general idea. My questions are, 

1) Can I pick any stock that have lower volume than $10K/day on average? I don't want it to be too high because then I can't have control over the price. I don't want it to be too low because then I can't sell or buy without causing myself a loss.

2) If it turns out someone distributed false info about the stock, will SEC find me even if they cannot prove my connection to the false info? After all I profited from this so I must be the actor behind the shill, in their opinion.

3) Any other tips? I am new to trading but this doesn't seem like a rocket science. Buy cheap, shill well, sell high, repeat"	How to find a good stock for me to buy, hold and shill?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fbsnun/how_to_find_a_good_stock_for_me_to_buy_hold_and/

mikehall1	1583028121	"Absolutely insane week last week, hope everyone did well. Of course, I am watching CODX IBIO APT... BUT there are a ton of other opporunities out there besides these crowded names. Here's a few ideas you can make money on:

** TRIL ** Closed strong over $5.00 w/ the daily chart breakout - one to watch Monday/Tuesday (if Monday is used as consolidation) -- watch over $5.50 w/ volume to push back towards highs and over $6

** TRIB ** CV play idea, CO is profitable and chart looks nice. Needs to hold trend over $1.20 in  the coming days and push over $1.80 with volume to get started with a big move. $2.00 is a key level over $1.80. 

** CBAY ** Moving averages lining up nicely on the daily for this one. Could be  a nice swing off the bottom key support off $1.55 area and push up to break $1.80s, then $2.00. One to keep on watch, it moves a bit slower so set a few price alerts and leave it! There's a large gap to fill over $2.20 which has worked well in the market lately.

** BIOC** Traded record volume on Friday and closed up 168% -- I'll be watching this one for continuation Monday morning off the key level of $0.60, we need to see a gap hold above that level and form higher lows towards the $1.00 level for the best case scenario breakout run.

** SPCE** Everyone has had their eyes on this one and it has pulled back hard since that $40 blowoff move. Watching this week for a bounce, as we are teetering over a key support level at $20.00 with likely a few short covering coming in. Not a bad R/R here towards $30 area.

** OGEN** Long this one on Friday @ $0.62. Gearing up on the daily chart towards the psychological level of $1.00. Expecting P2 data soon, so that's why we are seeing this volume come in - plus the sub $1 theme is hitting since Thursday/Friday. I'd like to see a gap up Monday morning and shove over $1.00 with volume for a nice run.

**NH** Breaking out on the daily chart with a positive reaction to ER on Friday. Technically speaking this stock looks great over the $2.50 level for a run towards the $3.00 area. I'd like to see it continue to hold above $2.00 on dips to show a sign of strength."

RamzFanz	1583012842	"I've been meaning to remind everyone they are approaching P2 results. I didn't want to jump the gun because every one of you autists has A.D.D. and no patience, but I goofed. It shot up 40% Friday and AH.

I would absolutely still invest, especially on a dip. I'm adding on any major dip.

We have 3-5 weeks for results. It's an FDA FastTrack and EU orphan drug with no approved competition so conditional approval or approval with good P2 results is possible which is why I'm playing P2 and not waiting for P3. They do have a competitor in P3, but it's an injectable, not a rinse.

OGEN has AG013. It's an oral rinse that is expected to both prevent and cure Oral Muctosis, a common and painful symptom of both chemo and radiation treatment. OM has no current treatment other than numbing agents and OM often leads to treatment failure, it's that painful.

Major partnerships and/or a buyout is also more than likely, in my estimation. There are no rumors, I'm not pumping, the numbers just dictate this is probable.

The market is very conservatively valued at $750M annually and that's only assuming a 15% penetration. 15% is ridiculously low for a painful and incurable illness that can lead to an early death. If they had said 75%, I wouldn't balk. It could literally be prescribed for almost all chemo/radiation patients, worldwide. True story.

There are no know side effects.

It's also only being tested for OM. It is likely, because of the way it works, it may prevent/cure/abate many blistering mouth and skin diseases.

It's a lantibiotic. Lantibiotics are the future with antibiotic resistance becoming a major issue.

At less than $1, though, we all know there have to be downside risks.

Risks:

* They have competition in P3. It's an injectable so it's not much of a long term issue, but that could deter conditional approval or approval after P2.
* If P2 results are bad, which is not at all expected but is possible, this stock is dead. They have a large library of lantibiotics (over 400) and a few other drugs but those are years away from reviving this stock from bad results, if ever. Do or die!
* The market is complete shit and may dampen the anticipated run. Of course, it could also heighten it as profit-makers are hard to find. I don't have any idea.
* They are funded through late 2020. If they don't announce a partnership or buyout after results, expect dilution.

I'm not at all sure how I'm going to wrap this trade up. I will probably swing half of it repeatedly in the coming weeks and exit most of it before or just after P2 results. I don't want to be holding a big bag if it dilutes."	OGEN is on the move!	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fbjoe4/ogen_is_on_the_move/

hchiyan0925	1582984166	"Relatively new investor here, especially in penny stocks, switched over this week due to the complete disaster that is the US markets right now. Disclaimer: After clearing $500 in the early hours of the 28th, I put in an order for $5000 at avg. 2.87, so I'm currently in the red. I got caught up in the frenzy over the day and didn't do as much DD as I usually do for even non-pennies. Now my skins in the game, time to do some analysis on how this might move.

*The Company*

This stock (As with most COVID stocks) are currently trading purely on technicals and no fundamentals (Posting continuous downwards revenue/losses YoY is enough to see that the company fundamentals don‚Äôt justify a price that‚Äôs over .50 cents), the company itself is also shaky, having been sued over misrepresentation of its role in combating Ebola (19m settlement). It is entirely possible that they are doing the same shit again with COVID, but the fact that there have been no announcements except for this partnership doesn‚Äôt seem to suggest they are bullshitting us round the block. They make plant-based vaccines as per client specification, with minimal R&amp;D on the part of developing the cure in the first place. 

Although I question whether 2 relatively small biopharma companies (iBio and their Chinese partners) can really outgun multi-billion dollar pharma in the race for the cure, them being in the race right now is more than enough to net big interest for the stock. 

For the 5th March shareholders meeting, I honestly don't know what to expect but predict some they either go down the Ebola route and lie about progress, show actual progress, or announce their acquisition. (All 3 of which would net gains in SP)

As of the 28th, the stock is netting a roughly 700% increase in the share price at its usual ""base"" level of $0.3 ish. It is good to see the AH hours not tanking, as this shows some confidence is still around the stock, and this is not a one day pump and dump affair, (although it is entirely possible this is a multiple day pump and dump affair, in which we ain't seen nothing yet. Trading volume on the 28th sitting at above 200m+ is a good sign that big guns are watching or are involved, but the fact that it kept hitting resistance on the 28th in the PM is making me question exactly how bullish the bulls are on this stock. It should be noted BlackRock (Yes, that BlackRock) owns 180k worth of shares acquired not too long before it exploded, and thus they may look to cash in soon, or they may want to blow this higher before cashing out. 

Comparing this with CODX (Which has an actual product that could work), the gain on CODX over the ""base level"" is currently 1300%, peaking at 2100% approximately a short while back.

It is entirely possible that this stock would blow past the 700% to hit past 1000% (Which was hit yesterday in the AM, right before the big crash (someone tanking the SP deliberately, no market forces involved) but due to the lack of any significant coverage or any progress report on any actual feasible product, I think the pure speculative hype around IBIO is not enough to get it to $20 or $30 or even $10 as some people are hoping. There is a lot of bullish sentiment on the stock by retail investors, however, there are also a lot of short positions, and thus, I'm uncertain, based on technicals alone, how this is going to go.

A lot of you had probably hoped that it would've ripped in the AH (So did I), but my guess is that a lot of big guys are cashing out on the profits made (holding from the .3-.5 levels), compounded by the weekend, + RHers and other weak hands letting go have slumped the AH performance somewhat (in addition to the Dow clawing back over the POTUS statements). I think the support level stays between 1.9-2 (barring any bullshit or market manipulation) and resistance being 2.8-3. 

Interesting to note is the S-3 filing, which seemingly has had no effect on the SP whatsoever, even if I personally do have some concern that if they throw all the shares into the market (considering the market cap as of 28th is about 180m, this would significantly dilute the SP) It must be noted the S-3 document is in relation to them having the right to ‚Äúshelve‚Äù and sell the securities from time to time, and thus what I think may happen is that they will drive the stock price more, prior to putting the shares on the market (to use the investors as an ATM per-se) shortly before it tanks. They also have a reverse-split to contend with, but since stock prices are way up, It is unclear whether this is going to happen or not. 

There is some extremely unsubstantiated information I read about on Stocktwit that suggests the March 5th shareholder meeting includes the disclosure of an acquisition of the company, and if that holds to be true, the stock can truly rip after that. (Take this with a grain of salt)

There is also currently an outstanding bid of 500k shares at price point 2.45 (consider AH closing at 2.07), and if that is true, then perhaps insiders know something we don‚Äôt, and this could also rip on this (presently unknown) information. (Also take this with a grain of salt).

*Market Sentiment:*

This is the fun part. COVID is now in full swing. The news of COVID is going from bad to worse. South Korea is done, and the United States is now in a borderline pandemic. In the past 24 hrs since market close, cases have been discovered to suggest extremely widespread transmission of COVID. 800 cases new cases in Korea, a bunch in Europe AND worst of all, mystery infections on the shores of the US. AND EVEN WORSE, it seems as though Humans are unable to produce a natural remedy to the COVID, judging by a bunch of people that got sick AGAIN after they were discharged in China. 

To say that Mondays open will be a sea of green would be beyond highly unlikely in my opinion. Institution investors are bracing for impact and its gonna hit way hard. (I had shares in AMD and all the growth stocks that just continually take a shit whenever bulls say it‚Äôs bottomed out) The Dow clawed back on the 28th because of the Feds and POTUS trying to drum up some market confidence by shouting fake news (and funnily enough, blaming the democrats) and introducing relief measures. This doesn‚Äôt stop stone-cold empirical numbers from instilling fear into millions. Living in a COVID struck area (Hong Kong), I know the damage this can create not only to supply chains and manufacturing but overall market sentiment, and willingness for people to go out, spend or do anything to contribute to the economy. Work from home also reduces productivity like a bitch, so be aware of this unforeseen impact on the economy.

I have sources in large Asian institutions that are confident that May/June will be the tipping point of rebound or entering a bearish market, completely dependent on whether the COVID dies off with the heat. (I think it will rebound)

All in all, this company SP is and will be based on market speculation and hype. I think the hype is somewhat warranted on the back of this disaster pandemic, and I think prices will top out $3.5-4 somewhere (with people panic buying if the Dow, again, is a sea of red this coming Monday) then tank, or soar if something comes out of the 5th of March meeting (maybe 6-8, but 10 would be a 3000% increase from base, and that seems a little high to me to ride off of sheer hype)

**I will be moving my money out if I‚Äôm green at open on Monday as I would have recouped my losses in the blue chips, but for all of you who are holding since pennies, I think the stock has someways to run. Wrote this fast, apologies for any errors.**

*[Keep in mind the asymptomatic period was reported to be at most 27 days](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/), which means public exposure in these countries could have began weeks ago. By Monday, I estimate that there will be at least 2,000 new cases in the above countries experiencing the new outbreaks alone.*


*Why does this matter? This weekend the Corona Virus news will be flowing steadily, thus IMO influencing the virus stocks to continue to rise on Monday and throughout next week.*

**Controlling the outbreak is going to become increasingly harder.**


[To control the majority of viral outbreaks, for R0 of 2-5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3¬∑5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1¬∑5. For R0 values of 2¬∑5 or 3¬∑5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30074-7/fulltext) 

[Researchers estimate the R0 value of COVID-19 to be likely between 4.7 and 6.6. Further, they speculate that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)

**Looking Forward to Next Week**

IMO, the virus news this weekend will be off the charts. As new outbreaks occur and the sustained outbreaks continue, the demand for these corona virus stocks will rise. 

I still stand by the recommendation from my initial posting, in which I suggested investing into the companies producing test kits and personal protection / medical equipment. 

I am still currently holding $APT, $AHPI, and $CODX. No vaccine companies at the moment. I feel that there is a great deal of profit to be made swinging these stocks using the 50, 100, and 200 day moving average. Take a look at how the stock behaved the last two days and find a plan that can work for you. Watch the volume in premarket as well on the various virus stock to get a sense of where the interest is for that day."

*Why does this matter? This weekend the Corona Virus news will be flowing steadily, thus IMO influencing the virus stocks to continue to rise on Monday and throughout next week.*

**Controlling the outbreak is going to become increasingly harder.**


[To control the majority of viral outbreaks, for R0 of 2-5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3¬∑5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1¬∑5. For R0 values of 2¬∑5 or 3¬∑5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30074-7/fulltext) 

[Researchers estimate the R0 value to be likely between 4.7 and 6.6. Further, they speculate that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)

Ritter has funding coming in and meeting with potential partners. Now is the time to get in, look at it‚Äôs growth today.

*This is my opinion but I‚Äôm usually right lol

$RTTR (Ritter Pharmaceuticals) also known as Ritter, has announced that their lead product, RP-G28, has the potential to become the first FDA-approved treatment for lactose intolerance, a condition that affects millions worldwide. RP-G28 has been studied in Phase 2 trials and is now in Phase 3 clinical development.  What does this mean for us investors? Well, if the FDA approves this treatment we are talking about major profits for a stock that‚Äôs merely 20 cents a share. They go on by stating ‚ÄúWe are further exploring the functionality and discovering the therapeutic potential gut microbiome changes may have on treating/preventing a variety of conditions including: gastrointestinal diseases, immuno-oncology, metabolic, and liver disease.‚Äù 

Can this be the next big pharmaceutical stock?

What do y‚Äôall think? And what other stocks do you think have potential?"	$RTTR (Ritter Pharmaceuticals) Will be the next big pharmaceutical stock.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/faxw9r/rttr_ritter_pharmaceuticals_will_be_the_next_big/

In these days of turmoil and the streets running red due to the cursed COVID19, I offer those brave enough to follow a small/micro cap company Ive bought for two years!  CEO is a Monsanto/Bayer alumni who knows alot about two topics: DRONES AND AGRICULTURE  $UAVS

VOLUME has been pouring in recently, where my miniscule purchases used to be entire days of volume, recently its been above 100k daily average all week.  They have a 5/1 assets to liability ratio in a young, growing, and high demand market that is still in its infancy.  $UAVS

Recently they secured a package delivery order for drones that has remained unnamed, but i assume not for long! Another bull reason is the rare find of a US based drone manufacturer! Did I forget to mention they have a deal with a Monsanto Bayer subsidiary.....

outstanding shares 15M (float) 

Conclusion - I am aiming to atleast hoard 100,000 shares prior to their upcoming earnings and an assumed news flash for the package delivery partner (UPS,DHL,WALMART, AMAZON ü§îü§îü§î) who is with Me? $UAVS

toddmhorst	1582758916	"I've just finished working on my stock scanner. It's meant to find the ""best of the best"" stocks for swing traders and investors.

I won't go into too many details on how I find good candidates, but if it has a high dividend, been bullish, making new highs, or otherwise killing it for the last year it should show up. Of course, it's all automated, so there are always some stocks that may sneak in that aren't supposed to be there, or be left out... In other words, you still have to do your due diligence.

The reason I created it is because everywhere I looked I would find a small list that match this criteria, and then another small list for that criteria. My list has them all in one bucket, so you can see when something matches more than one of your criteria.

I do have a lot of data points, so I have several views, but clicking on any symbol will display all of its data. All the view show the same set of symbols, just sorted differently and with different data immediately visible.

Here is a YouTube video demonstrating it's use.
https://youtu.be/h4AD7vTPWTk

Some features:
-Sort any column or combination of columns
-Hide a security if you don't want to see it
-Works great on mobile or desktop
-Refreshes each night to get you 500-1000 symbols each with the newest data
-Quick search for a symbol/name
-Filter based on criteria you define
-View symbol chart in modal, pop up window, or new tab

Cost-
For the next month (until 4/1, no joke) I am allowing the demo account FREE unrestricted access to the full list of symbols. After that, I'll only return the top 20 (which will still helpful). At that point you'll need to have a paid account to view the whole list. An account costs $9.99 a month.

What else you get-
My site helps you track your stock/option positions. It's easy and quick to enter them in, and for options it properly handles rolling or adjusting positions. By using stats, the goal is for me to help you see where you are successful. Hopefully this will empower you to develop a strategy that you are comfortable with and that is profitable.

What I need from you-
I need you to use the demo account (provided under the sign in form) to log in, see what you like and don't like (about site in general and scanner specifically), and let me know. I'm just a developer who likes to invest in options, so any feature ideas, needed stats, and bug fixes will help me and my users. Of course, if you find value or just want to support the project, I'd love for you to sign up as well. The scanner is located under the 'Leads' menu.

Coming next-
Trade alerts are coming next. I'm not a guru, but I have had success and learned a lot in the past year and a half. Alerts will allow me to share my trades, AS WELL as allow you to share your trades.

I won't be charging extra for any of these features, so I really believe it is worth your money, and is completely affordable to all.

I posted a [video ](https://youtu.be/3epTlJnn3Jc) but figured I'd have a text version too just in case. 

**TNXP** Only interested if this gaps up back above $1 - that would be the scenario in which any overnight shorts are scared + longs feel comfortable to jump back in. IF we gap over $1 I'd look to trade a push at the open testings today's highs.

**CODX** I'm not one to try to predict things, because trying to predict how a stock is going to move is a very risky thing. I'd rather wait until I have more information to go off of in the premarket tomorrow -- gapping after hours already so if we gap up again tomorrow morning, that would be the best case scenario.

**APT** this one has a lot of potential imo. I'd like to see this gap up in the PM + give an opportunity of weakness to get a lower entry towards $12 / $12.50 area depending on your risk level/sizing + trade a pop over highs at the open. Over today's highs this has room towards $15 area based on psychological levels.

**VXRT** swing I was in from $1.20 but sold out of today -- looking for potential day 2 continuation IF $1.50 holds higher low trend back towards today's highs.

**Guyana Goldstrike Selects Drill Targets at Toucan Ridge Discovery Area, Marudi Gold Project, Guyana**

Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (GYA.V /GYNAF) has selected drill targets at the Marudi gold project, located in Guyana, South America.

The company's 2018/2019 trenching program successfully outlined a new mineralized area that continues for more than 1.75 kilometres along Toucan Ridge. Toucan Ridge is roughly one kilometre northeast of the Mazoa Hill zone, which currently contains the project's mineral resource estimate (please see mineral resource estimates section herein).

A diamond drill program of up to 12 holes is planned and may be extended. The planned drill program will predominately focus on Toucan Ridge, where a total of 2,458 metres of trenching were completed and 837 samples were taken.

Drill targets have been chosen from identified magnetic anomalies and gold assays from surface trenching and sampling of the quartzite-metachert host rock.

The specific drill locations will be in proximity to trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8, as priority targets, followed potentially by drilling trench areas TTR-18-9, TTR-18-11, TTR-18-12 and TTR-18-13.

In 2018, trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 assayed grades as high as 7.2 grams per tonne gold over three metres.

The first drill pads will be positioned to drill angled holes across the area of trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 to an initial planned depth of 130 metres and a maximum depth of 200 metres.

In preparation for the next phase of exploration, the technical team has reviewed the legacy data, including drill assays, drill angles, collar location, grade and interval lengths, from past drilling on the property in order to further refine its exploration efforts at Marudi. The compilation of these historic drill assays will provide important information that the technical team will use to calibrate drilling on the property.

The assay highlights disclosed herein are from the Mazoa Hill zone, which is approximately one kilometre southwest of the Toucan Ridge discovery area.

Assay highlights of Sutton Resources' diamond drill programs at the Mazoa Hill zone (1991 to 1994):

* MR 91-068 -- six metres of 29.97 grams per tonne gold within 72 metres of 5.11 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 91-074 -- 15 metres of 15.30 grams per tonne gold within 75 metres of 4.60 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 94-102 -- 52 metres of 4.06 grams per tonne gold within 190 metres of 2.39 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 94-113 -- 36 metres of 7.74 grams per tonne gold within 141 metres of 3.31 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 94-115 -- 45 metres of 10.82 grams per tonne gold and 30 metres of 15.16 grams per tonne gold within 81 metres of 7.71 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 94-120 -- 12 metres of 16.65 grams per tonne gold within 57 metres of 4.51 grams per tonne gold.

Mineral resource estimates

The Mazoa Hill zone contains the company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggest that the mineralized zone is open in several directions, including at depth:

* 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 grams per tonne;
* 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 grams per tonne.

It's a 3 wheeled electric car, but for legal purposes its classifed as a motorcycle on the federal level, which means cheaper insurance among other things. $20,000 it's got a range of 102 miles per charge. The 174 MPGe is almost double that of a tesla. Top speed is 75mph so it can go on any highway.

&amp;#x200B;

On gas cars you couldn't really make 3 wheels work that well because you need a large engine, transmission and it just didn't work that well. With EVs the electrical compenents can be shifted around and places almost whereever making the 3 wheeler more promising. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

I found old open source project called FreedomEV, basically it was a group of hobbiest seeking to build a 3 wheel electric cars and help the masses. One person of this project was able to build the frame, brakes, motor, and wheels and sell that completed for $6,000 (just add battery and electric controller) [https://i.imgur.com/rFxV3Dl.png](https://i.imgur.com/rFxV3Dl.png)

&amp;#x200B;

For arcimoto, based on the formula 174 MPGe to mi/kWh = 5.16 mi/kWh. We can tell that the battery size for FUV car will be 20Kwh and will likely be standard 16850 cells. So at a price of $262 per Kwh/pack, that comes to a total of $5,240‚Ä¨ for the battery. Or in other words about $12,000 for the whole car, and a selling price of $20,000 thats really profitable. Currently they have over 2,000 preorders, so that would equal about $16million in profit. That's enough to give them a positve earnings per share once they start shipping."

mikehall1	1582667956	" **2/26 Watches**

**CODX** First breakout day that has held up well - this is a great sign. Tomorrow, as long as we don't gap down below $4 in the premarket, I'll be looking to join any weakness above that level for a push at the open back over $4.50. Over $4.50 this has room towards $5.00.

**COCP** Reclaimed VWAP late day with another day trading &gt; 70M shares of volume... This is NOT done yet. Needs to holds dips &gt; the $2.15 microshelf in the morning for shorts to stay stuck -- a break over $2.60 has room towards $3.00.

**VVPR** absolutely destroyed today - watching this one tomorrow for any significant pop towards $1.90 for a day 2 fade.

**GNPX** teetering above $6 today - clearly a line in the sand for momentum. A gap up in the morning &gt; $6.50 can bring us back towards today's highs and over that we're clear. Looked weak into the close today so a breakdown under $6 will be rough for longs and will likely hit some stops until $5.50 area.

**TRCH** above $0.70 can see a move towards $0.80/$0.90 with the gap fill on the daily.

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - February 25, 2020) - Sun Kissed Industries Inc. (OTC Pink: SKDI) (""Sun Kissed"", ""SKDI"", or the ""Company""), an emerging leader in the CBD Food and Beverage marketplace, is excited to announce that the Company's recent acquisition, Products Group Inc, DBA/ Hakuna Supply (""Hakuna""), has initiated a series of measures to optimize operational efficiency, increase output, and drive a substantial increase in revenue growth over the next several quarters.

Hakuna has already begun the construction of a new Clean Room, which represents an important part of this initiative. The Clean Room is expected to be fully operational by March 13, 2020.

""Hakuna has a very strong stable of award-winning products and a large nationwide distribution footprint in a booming market niche,"" noted Carl Grant, CEO of Sun Kissed. ""But one of the reasons we acquired the company is their optimally positioned stage of growth. This is truly a top emerging brand in the high-end CBD-based products space. The capability to increase Hakuna's output translates into sales growth and a wider awareness of the Hakuna brand. At this point, the story is about scaling up and widening margins on variable cost inputs.""

New measures being taken by Hakuna will include a fully operational clean room, new equipment (industrial mixer, industrial hopper, and capsule packaging machine for coffee goods etc.), and several additional steps to streamline the operational sequence from order to shipment of product.

Hakuna management believes these steps will reduce the time lag between placement of a new order and shipment of that order by over 50% to just 48 hours and increase overall output by over 50%. The net effect of these adjustments are expected to drive a significant increase in revenue over the next two quarters alone.

Hakuna is an award-winning CBD-products company, currently nominated for ""Best Hemp-Derived CBD Product"" by the California Cannabis Awards after winning the DOPE Magazine Best New Product award for Southern California in the non-cannabis/non-tech category in 2017. Hakuna was also just awarded ""Runner Up"" at the Los Angeles Coffee &amp; Donut Festival People's Choice Coffee Awards for 2019. Hakuna generates significant revenues with a substantial distribution footprint, including over 110 established retail distribution partners across over 20 states in the domestic US market.

Grant concluded, ""We have a great deal of faith in Ilan Freeman and his team to successfully pluck the low-hanging fruit from the vine. Hakuna is ready to scale up as a leadership brand in the CBD products space.""

mikehall1	1582585901	"2/25 Watches

**LPCN** up 67% and gapping after hours - this shows a strong setup for day 2 continuation tomorrow. I'd like to see continued volume in the premarket above $0.65 to confirm day 2 interest in the stock. On the daily chart, we have a gap above $1 -- this is likely the ultimate target if everything goes as planned premarket. A push towards $1 will require a break over the after hours highs of $0.775 w/ &gt; 150k volume per minute. 

**COCP** big runner today off virus news -- looking for a gap up tomorrow above $1.75 + ultimately push towards $2 magnet level. Play this one safe with smaller size.

**TOCA** held $1.90 again today - this has proved to be a key level for this stock multiple times now. I'll be watching for a similar play as we had this morning, tomorrow. We need to see the stock holding above that key level again tomorrow in the premarket (with no negative news / offering) and we can pop again at the open towards $2.50.

**CODX** needs to hold $3.70 in the premarket on any dips + see a break back over $4 with consistent volume. This one has had trouble holding gains lately, so we need to see confirmation of interest day 2.

**VXRT** swing idea looking solid, looking for a breakout + trend hold over $1.40 tomorrow or in the coming days this week. Clear R/R levels on the daily chart. Over $1.40 this has room towards the $1.80 level.

**ELGX** Really impressive bounce off lows -- look for continuation tomorrow IF $0.95 support holds and a breakout over $1.15 can run towards $1.50 on good volume."	Watchlist 2/25	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f905mi/watchlist_225/

But my other issue is I don't have a lot of money. At most I'd be comfortable with putting $50 down on a stock or some stocks every paycheck. But I'm out of my element here. I'm comfortable with doing market research and whatnot and my ultimate goal is to no longer be broke as fuck. At $700 every two weeks from my full-time job that's not exactly phenomenal.

TOCAGEN INC is a clinical-stage, cancer-selective gene therapy company. It focuses on the development of product candidates designed to activate a patient's immune system against their own cancer from within. 

**MRKT CAP:** $45.406M

**OUTSTANDING SHARES:** 23.898M (!!!)

**NEWS:** $TOCA recently announced a **reverse merger** with Forte Bioscience in all-stock deal. (!!!)

**AVG PRICE:** Tocagen‚Äôs stock nearly doubled since the announcement, but that‚Äôs not saying much as it‚Äôs been floating around the **50-cent** mark since its layoffs in October.  **It broke this resistance price, now it's on the 1.Xs.**

**BAD NEWS:** The company reported in September that its lead candidate, a gene therapy called **Toca 511** and **Toca FC**, **failed** a phase 3 study targeting patients with recurrent high-grade glioma undergoing surgery to remove their tumor.

**GOOD NEWS:** The merger is slated to close in the second quarter, after which an investor syndicate including OrbiMed, Alger and BVF Partners will **invest** **$14 million**. 

That will bring the company‚Äôs war chest to **$25 million** as it looks to advance its lead asset, FB-401, and other clinical programs. Forte expects to start a **phase 2 study of FB-401**, a live biotherapeutic, by the middle of the year. 

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**: Given that this broke the cents mark, I can only see this going up, or staying around that price until mid-year. 

**IF YOU PLAY OPTIONS**: Premium are very low for a monthlies. One expiring in September, is less than $1 per contract. A put won't be a bad idea, but given the investment + new leadership + new company (two companies for 1): it will lose money in the short-term.

**IF YOU PLAY STOCKS**:  Buy, hold hold hold. This is not a quick buck stock."	Cancer cure? $TOCA might have it	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7uly7/cancer_cure_toca_might_have_it/

They have over 800 million shares, and on yahoo shareholders have stated a proxy for a 40 to 1 reverse split.

It's currently 11 cents, half a year ago it was 50 cents. If they rally before a RS it's worth it to buy in now right? But if they RS at a lower or equal price it's not worth jumping now? 

Also after a RS many companies follow with an offer and dilution, they also only own 1%, not sure but they may try a buyback of shares at some point also.

ChattyChris	1582307171	"first here is the updated meme  [https://i.imgur.com/gRzl4Hi.png](https://i.imgur.com/gRzl4Hi.png)   


1. There are other cars besides tesla and the other cars can't use the supercharger
2. If the supercharger is cheaper then the lines will be longer. A quick search says it cost 0.28/kwh super charger VS 0.39/kwh on blink. So it's a extra $6 for a full tank to avoid a multihour waiting period sounds reasonable. Not to mention location matters more, if the the Blink is on your way home and your only half filling the tank, thats a $3 premium. still sound bad? Even matters more is what is avaliable charging in the parking lot when you goto the grocery store/gym/ect
3. Not everyone has a driveway and can't run a extension cord through a apartment complex parking lot. or have to park down the street in the city.
4. Cost of EVs is expected to drop so more on the road in the future means a growing market.

majestik30	1584397643	"On Feb 25th I made a $1k transfer into robinhood which became available immediately. Two days later in the same week, I made a $5k transfer into robinhood which wouldn't become available because of my initial $5k transfer (most everyone knows this simple fact). Robinhood even messaged me to remind me that I would have to wait a few days for the full $5k to become available. 

March 3rd I ended my day with, I believe, a few hundred in my cash balance and no outstanding orders. 

March 4th I sign into my account to find a cash balance of $4,765.50 and a notice stating my $5k is now available for trading. 

Now, my math isn't all that but even I can tell you something ain't right with those numbers. 

I contacted robinhood numerous times through their help links and their attempts at a response were to explain to me how balances work and that I must have used the first thousand of the $5k since $1k would become immediately available from that transfer. None ever actually addressed the issue of the missing money. 

The last guy even seemed to understand and wrote that none of the $5k would become available immediately because of my initial $1k transfer two days earlier. But even he didn't address the missing money. I guess he also didn't bother doing the math. 

I write this as a warning to all of you who currently use our are thinking of using robinhood. Your money isn't safe and they could care less with their generic responses.

Ideanomics ( Nasdaq:**IDEX**) Announces approximately 1.5 Billion RMB ($ 215M)  Electric Vehicle Order from Sichuan Shenwu Yunli Transportation

  
 \-Order is for 2,000 8x4 meter heavy trucks, for construction project use 

  
 \-Multi-year order is subject to lease financing via MEG and order fulfilment runs through 2022/2023

&amp;#x200B;

BEIJING / NEW YORK, March 16, 2020 / -Ideanomics, (NASDAQ: IDEX), announced a new vehicle order through its MEG subsidiary from construction services company Sichuan Shenwu Yunli Transportation Services Co., Ltd., the leading construction site dump truck operator in Southwest China provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou.

The order is for 2,000 8x4 meter heavy dump trucks, for use in construction projects in various locations. The vehicles cost approximately 750,000 Renminbi (approx. $ 107,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling in the region of 1.5 Billion Renminbi, or approximately $ 215 Million USD.

The vehicles will be procured from a number of manufacturers within MEG's partner alliance and will be subject to a rolling delivery schedule throughout 2020 and beyond. MEG has identified commercial heavy trucks as a strategic segment of its business, and one in which it feels it can derive significant revenues in the next few years as EV heavy trucks deliver significant ROI for fleet operators in terms of fuel savings.

""We are very pleased to be working with Mobile Energy Group and their Qingdao sales hub for this order, which will see us convert our fleet of heavy construction vehicles starting in 2020 and completing over the course of the next two to three years,"" said Yang Guang, Chairman of Sichuan Shenwu Yunli Transportation Services Co., Ltd. ""The MEG team's expertise and knowledge of the EV truck market, and the associated financing and rebate structures required for the electric vehicle market, were a key factor in our decision in the timing and placement of this order. ""

turbonic1	1584294136	Evidence shows that many Technology and Security companies colluded to whitewash the theft of Sector 10‚Äôs Disruptor Technology that was intended to provide all Fire Departments with Real Time GPS Tracking and VoIP Communications. The system known as PLX-3D was Patented in 2000 and expanded in 2007.  It was stolen and is now known as PSIM. A trial is scheduled for May 11th 2020 for 5 days in the Utah court system. Shareholders believe that if $SECI wins just 1 Billion in damages that one share of $SECI will be worth $3,275 per share because only 306,000 shares exist because Sector 10 was forced to do 3 reverse stock splits due to rampant price manipulation.  Last official price trade of a block of 100 shares traded for $11.50 but most recent shares bought have traded around the price of $23.00   A few very Interesting things have happened recently such as a level 3 paid basher has shown up at the InvestorsHub SECI message board 2 weeks ago out of nowhere joining 5 other lower level paid bashers that have been working the message board relentlessly for a long time. Also ironically Sector 10 just pulled there two websites Sector10.com and WhiteCollarFacades.com down even though they still own the domain site. The CEO was using a Twitter account to get out press releases and his most recent press release stated to be patient that the trial is imminent and that they could not answer any questions as to how the damages would be shared or how it would effect the stock price due to legal strategies. He also added the #FBI and #UT in the message which shareholders understand implies as plans for a Federal RICO trial to be announced in the future. Many shareholders believe these are very positive signs that a Settlement deal maybe close to being completed with a Non Disclosure Agreement as a part of it which would explain the websites being strategically pulled down. Price manipulation has been occurring for a long period of time and there was a short squeeze in play when this stock ran to $71 a few years ago.  All of the Due Diligence information is available at InvestorsHub.com in the SECI message board.  I am a Firefighter and came across this stock by accident almost 3 years ago when it was the #1 performance gainer on the top 10 Nasdaq list.  It seems to be a true David vs Goliath story as the CEO estimates there are over 200 companies illegally using Sector 10‚Äôs Disruptor technology now in other ways.  The core part of Sector 10‚Äôs technology was a Large Scale Data Analytics Tool that the Defendants stole and used and shared with up to 200 other Technology and Security companies for unknown Billions in profits.  The May 11th trial will determine if this is a true unicorn stock with massive Return On Investment potential.  Best of luck to any getting shares prior to the trial as the CEO Pericles DeAvilla‚Äôs message has always been ‚ÄúBe very careful with your shares‚Äù and ‚ÄúLock the Float‚Äù.   God bless Sector 10 receiving full justice and ridiculous damages for the theft of there Disruptor Technology intended to provide Firefighters with Real Time GPS Tracking and VoIP Communications.	$SECI only has 40 trading days left until potentially Billions in damages will be decided in the Utah court verses the many Defendants and also paving the way for a future Federal RICO trial.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fj550y/seci_only_has_40_trading_days_left_until/

1.I whould like to use dollar cost avareging strategy because it doesn't require much every day.I just put every month some money in the market.Buy at same date very months,the same stocks.But i have seen some people that say that this strategy doesn't work and that you can make profit.Is that true?I just want to do this for a couple of months and when I need the money I can just sell all the stocks and take the make back+the profit.

2.Momentum trading.This is one seems a little bit to hard for me because I don't have that much time every day.Plus this is for me seems a lot riskier.

sliight	1584163041	"Hi all,

Have been researching random crap and during the AYTU buy I noticed the W and Z, which led me to research warrants.

From that I can tell the AYTUZ warrant had a buy price of $1.86 which would be awesome at the half a cent cost today, I'd load up on $10k worth for that kind of chance knowing the run this thing could make... Overnight millionaire chance there...

So then I thought, pretty sure others would know about this and the price should be near the stock price, but it isn't...

More research... Reverse split... 

So tell me if I understand this correctly. The 20:1 reverse split AYTU did after the warrants were issued means the strike price of $1.86 is now 20 times higher at $37.20?  So half a cent buys me the ability to buy the stock at $37.20, and is basically worthless unless it gets in the $30+ range without being too close to expiration which is about 18 months out... That all accurate?

Anyone mess with warrants? Seems like they're a lot like options to me, just company issued instead..."	AYTUZ warrant	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fidimv/aytuz_warrant/

sliight	1584133763	"So years ago when I still liked poker I used to crush tournaments because I was forced to be patient, as once you're out of chips you're done... live action though I could be impatient and impulsive, which I am by nature in terms of gambling, so I'd often have huge swings in live action and often lose everything I'd made from tournaments... 

Anyways, as I realized my consistent ass kickings, I started a simple rule that I'd never break.  I could only ever invest 10% of my gambling bankroll.  Bad day, might lose all 10%... next time around I have less to invest as I can only invest 10% of the 90% I have leftover... good days, I can invest more the next time.

So, I took this premise over to my stock gambling.  I've been sitting on crap safe investments (zero stocks) since June and pretty much stayed completely out of market waiting for the crash.  Now that it's hit I'm researching the safe stocks to put the retirement crap into, but in doing so started looking at gambling stocks. Just broke my rule and did 30% of my fun bankroll on AYTU (in at $1.66) and I'm bit bit irritated with myself for breaking my rule.  Don't really care if it goes to crap as that's the nature of my gambling bankroll, I'm fully comfortable losing it all, but of course don't want to... I almost doubled down to get my buy down, but realized that would be extra stupid so I'll just hold and watch.

All that said, I'm interested in what rules you folks may have for your gambling money... Do you have rules?  Are you addicted and just use spare money from your paychecks in hopes of to the moon?  Love to hear any additional tactics...  If and when I have time I was thinking about starting to mess around with the turtle investing tactic tracking averages... With mortgage rates so low I'm buried so it will be some time before I have that kind of time during the day to watch stuff.

Appreciate any insights, and excited to hear how people manage their funds vs emotions with or without rules...

The results have been very solid so far. Past results indicate this will be 70%+ effective.

AG013 is a one-of-a-kind Severe Oral Muctosis prevention and cure. SOM is experienced by 70% of chemo/radiation patients. SOM leads to severe mouth pain, inability to eat or drink, and sometimes treatment failure.

There is no FDA approved competitor and the competitor in trials is an injectable vs OGEN's oral rinse.

This FDA fast-tracked and EU orphan drug could get conditional approval or even full approval without a phase 3.

3,000,000 share insider buy a few weeks ago at MARKET prices taking the insider to 15% ownership of OGEN along with major ownership of other companies contracted with OGEN. It APPEARS he may be angling toward a buyout, with good results.

AG013, with good results, is easily a $750M a year drug. That is a wildly conservative estimate assuming only 15% market penetration, with no competition.

This was rising into results before the market meltdown. It hit .94 right before. It could continue to go sideways or even down until results. It won't matter when it's $3-$5 and that's what the company is worth with good results. This price, at this point, with these results and catalysts, is ridiculously low.

However, if results are bad, which isn't at all expected but is *always* possible, this is dead for years.

I have been promoting this ticker and swinging it for a year and a half with much success. I now own [16,000 shares](https://imgur.com/a/1HH7RYS). This is the end game. I'm either very right or very wrong.

The only reason to buy this is to go into results between now and April. If you grab a tiger by the tail, hang on. The market is what it is and nothing is immune. However, a $750M drug will not be ignored.

Please be careful out there. Do your research. Do yourself a favor and don't buy hype."	Last call for OGEN?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fi1e4m/last_call_for_ogen/

Couple days ago they announced that they projected 420million sales of their product.

Today is day Ten, so they should be making a third announcement sometime today, so it's worth considering getting in now because the news will likely pump the stock.

Today all shares of SPEX are traded in for AIKI because the company is changing its name along with the ticker.

In addition to this, all limit orders have been canceled meaning it would have less resistance on the way up if it were to rise (assuming many of those limit sell orders aren't immediately placed again). Now because today is the day they change their name if they do a press release with an update on their COVID patent it should drive many new buyers to the stock.

TheBreadMakerr	1584076381	"So I wanted to share my thoughts on the overall market outlook and what to do with your money when it comes to stocks, 401k, IRAs, and Mortgages. I know most people reading this have probably never experienced anything remotely close to this before in their lifetime. The information I am going to go over below are just my personal opinions and what I would do.

### Market Outlook

I'm going to break this portion up into three sections. The first section I will discuss the earlier issues we experienced with COVID-19 in China. The second section will go over how COVID-19 impacts the market over the next 6-12 months. And the third section I will discuss what I call ""The Perfect Storm"".

**Big Business Supply Chain**

So to start we need to understand how the original impacts of COVID-19 in China have and will impact our market. Over 75% of US companies had their supply chains disrupted due to China having to shut down during the outbreak. Why does this matter? Well think about some of the big companies that had this happen, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel. A lot of these companies have already come out and said that they are going to miss their expected earnings during the next quarter. I believe this is already somewhat priced in but I believe the recovery time for these business will be much longer than 1 quarter. You can expect most of these companies to suffer from this for the next 6-9 months at least. So now you have to realize that a lot of large corporations are going to miss their quarterly earnings for up to the next year.

**COVID-19 and the United States**

We just briefly went over how these businesses supply chains got thrown out of whack and could take up to a year to recover. Now COVID-19 has crept its way into the US and is already presenting some big time operational issues for these same businesses that are already dealing with supply chain problems. As you may have heard over the past couple days a lot of businesses are trying to find ways to allow employees to work remotely or sending people home, schools are shutting down, sporting leagues are getting suspended and this is just the first few thousand cases that have been identified. How does this impact the market? Well, let's think about tech companies, a lot of these companies have yearly computer, phone, smart device, tablet upgrades. How are they going to meet that demand when they had supply chain delays in China and are now experiencing operations slow downs in the US? Point blank - they aren't. Most of these companies are more than likely to announce significant delays in product launches which is going to trigger uncertainty from shareholders which will result in drop in stock prices. This is going to be a prevalent theme for quite a while. This is going to cause fear in investors and continue to see heavier sell volume than buy volume over the next 6-9 months until these companies stabilize again.

**The Perfect Storm**

Let me breakdown what I am calling the perfect storm and why I think it is going to shake things up further with the market. The first part of this perfect storm is what I covered above which is COVID-19, I already detailed why this is going to impact the market and have a lasting effect over the next 6 months. The second part is the recent Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price wars, the oil and gas sector has taken a huge hit due to this and combined that with COVID-19 and travel bans, you now have a pandemic across the world and a war on oil overseas. The third and final piece of this perfect storm is the upcoming election. The run-up to an election always shakes up the stock market because you have all these shareholders having uncertainty when it comes to the candidates and who is going to be best for businesses and who is projected to win and this causes major ebbs and flows in the market as we get closer to a presidential election. So now lets review, we have uncertainty with COVID-19 and what the current and future impacts will be. We have uncertainty on the oil price war overseas and how that's going to play out, and in about 3-4 months we will have uncertainty within the market around the election. Combining all these factors we will see some continued significant drops over the next 12 month period.

At this point I do believe we will fall into an economic recession based off the above information, we will be in a downtrend for at least the next 6 months and depending on how long it takes the US to recover from COVID-19 we could see the impact for at least 1 year potentially longer.

### Ok, So What Do I Do With My Money?

Let's kick things off by discussing your 401k, so I'm sure some of you that are younger may be freaking out a bit and wondering should I sell out of my 401k funds and just keep the account cash? Should I move the funds into bonds? Let me give you this to think on, so lets say you can't withdraw your 401k for at least another 10 years, in my opinion your best bet is to leave your 401k alone, don't touch it. You may think, how does that make any sense? Well for starters the market always bounces back so I wouldn't worry too much about seeing your account balance go down in the short term, always remember that your 401k is a long term play. The other factor is you can view this as an opportunity, I would recommend to continue to put money towards your 401k as it allows you to essentially average yourself down on the shares that you currently have. This presents a great opportunity for you to see a nice increase in the shares you buy now and for the foreseeable future because those shares will eventually become very profitable once the market comes out of the bear market/recession a few years from now. Think about the prices that people were able to buy their 401k shares at back in 2008 and how much of a come up they have seen since. Have that mindset going into this upcoming time.

The next topic I wanted to touch on is something I have gotten a lot of questions on the past few weeks, which is investors and traders asking me What Should I Buy Into? Well right now, I believe the answer is: Nothing! In my opinion COVID-19 news is going to get worse, more cases, more business and educational challenges, more high profile people getting diagnosed. Remember when China first had the outbreak it grew exponentially the first few weeks before leveling off, the same thing is going to happen in the US. Until we start to see it level off a bit, then market is going to see some violent swings to the downside, I don't believe a good buying opportunity will present itself for at least another 10-14 days maybe longer. Once we get past the brunt of it, I believe some of the best longer term plays to invest in will be the Oil and Gas sector. Two of the leaders in this sector are COP and XOM, these stocks pay a nice dividend, are sector leaders and have been around forever. They both have lost roughly 50% of their per share value and are setup well for you to make a healthy return within the next few years. Look back when these stocks took a dive in 2016 and the recovery they have had since. This presents another great opportunity to buy in and hold for some big returns. Just remember, you more than likely will not catch the very bottom on these stocks, I recommend entering with a starter position and gradually scale yourself in to maximize your potential returns.

The last thing I wanted to touch on is your mortgage. A lot of people are inquiring about refinancing their homes right now. This is not a bad idea if you can at least shave 0.75 points off your interest rate. However, I personally believe rates will continue to drop as we go through these trying times, I believe the opportunity will present itself over the next 6 months to get an even lower rate. I also believe we may see additional federal rate cuts to assist homeowners and help with the potential economic recession we will be entering. I would recommend if you really need to refinance to help out your financial situation right now then go ahead and do it if you will save more than 0.75 points by doing so. However, if you are in a more comfortable position currently you may want to hold out a little longer for the potential of snagging an even lower rate and presenting yourself with a better financial opportunity.

### Final Thoughts

That about wraps up my market outlook and my thoughts on how to best handle your money during these times. I believe if you are on the younger side, don't get discouraged about what's happening, look at it as an opportunity to grow your financial wealth and knowledge. We are in weird time where a lot of uncertainty is entering the market and our daily lives. I recommend checking out some stock charts and information from back in the 1980s or 2008 to see what happened and how the market recovered and think about the opportunity you may presented with to capitalize on this and set yourself up well for the future.

Only company that has any experience with the corona viruses and worked on developing products and medicine for mers which is the respiratory infection caused by the viruses.

Granted 5,000,000 from Linda &amp; gates foundation for research 

First round of vaccine testing was successful and ""Provided the hoped immune system response."", Although, they have not yet attempted human testing.

They are projected to put the vaccine into place in April and put out 1,000,000 dosages by the end of 2020. They also mentioned they would need help with distribution of the dosages, as they couldn't distribute enough themselves for the pubic health.

Coming out with multiple new products for respiratory problems etc. these have been shown to at least be somewhat effective.

dp79	1584033547	"I thought I‚Äôd share here something I looked into. 

Today, $AYTU filed a 13G today in which it disclosed that Sabby Mgmt owns 6M shares. They were likely part of one of the offerings. 

http://filings.irdirect.net/data/1385818/000153561020000080/0001535610-20-000080.txt

This is significant because Sabby also was part of $CODX‚Äôs offering on January 27th. This was right before CODX announced that they had completed development of their test kits and that they were successful in detecting CV. CODX announced this on January 31st. 

[CODX 13G for Sabby](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1535610/000153561020000062/codx0120.txt)

The point here is that Sabby obviously has some inside information that shows they know the Aytu tests are legit, effective, and will pass FDA EUA. 

The other point is that Sabby has a much higher stake in Aytu than CODX. No hedge fund would purchase a HIGHER stake in a competitive position unless they firmly believe that their product is better. 

At this point, I think the FDA EUA approval is a foregone conclusion and that Aytu‚Äôs tests are the real thing.

If I weren‚Äôt invested in Corona virus/health stocks, I wouldn‚Äôt be worried because obviously the entire market is crashing.

TidePod442	1583973769	"Here's a bit of info that I've gathered about PCTL. IMO, the company is real, their technology is patented and it seems to be needed. 

The product: The product is a patented, human-safe system that provides cleaning, sanitizing, disinfecting and decontaminating fluid solutions to tackle microbial infection and infestations. Their products and solutions are designed to take an environmentally mindful approach at combatting the spread of infectious diseases and contamination in the Healthcare and Cleaning industry as well as contributing to the sustainability of global natural resources in the energy and agricultural markets. 

The markets they serve and/or looking to serve so far include: Hospitals and Healthcare, Agriculture, Oil and Gas, Hotel and Tourism, Food/Service Production, recently looking to break into the Cannabis industry.

Their current clients are 8 hospitals (11 units) with 3 more hospitals coming within the next few weeks, along with more in the pipeline. 

PCT UK, the joint venture partner in Britain commenced a 60-day test Jan 15th ‚Äì the end of March to verify the results that they have had in the states. Unless bacteria and viruses are any different in the UK (they are not), there will be no difficulty in verifying the claims. 

Some things that Gary Grieco, CEO of PCT has stated recently:

‚ÄúHas grown 400% the last year and on target to grow exponentially this current year. Company is growing far more efficient and loses are down significantly.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCurrently trading on OTC, ""PCTL"" aspires to and is actively engaged in preparations for up-listing its common stock to a national securities exchange. The Company established entry into its target markets with commercially viable products in the United States and now continues to gain market share in the U.S. and U.K.‚Äú¬†

""As a result of the capabilities and benefits of our products,¬†many companies and municipalities across a variety of industries and geographic locations are engaging in intense discussions with PCT LTD."" 

**""The 800 pound gorilla, Corona-virus, that has opened up a huge opportunity for us and I cannot say any more than we have been contacted by, and are actively negotiating to address the problem with both companies and government officials and I cannot say more than that.""** 

Seems like it may be a good longterm investment, but I'm just a noob and don't know what I'm doing so I recommend doing your own DD and deciding for yourself :)

&gt;**Aurora Cannabis**¬†([NYSE:ACB](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/aurora-cannabis-inc/acb/)) is not resilient to turbulent markets, and it appears they are on the verge now of being de-listed from the national level exchanges, and file with over the counter markets in the USA and Canada.  
&gt;

JWTrader	1585711726	"1.  No one should be holding penny stocks for more than 2 days.  These things are running 100+% everyday of the week, TAKE YOUR PROFITS and ONTO THE NEXT.

2.  If a stock has ran +300% in a day or two, it's probably a good idea to not get into them.  Those who bought the top of TOPS, WTRH, AYTU, etc, you should absolutely know better.  FOMO will get you killed.

3.  Set a stop loss.  Yes, it sucks to see a stock run up 100% after you took your 20-30%, but you can never lose money if you always close green!! THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER STOCK!!!

This market is amazing. 100% runners everyday, don't FOMO on ones that have already ran! 

Good luck guys!"	Penny Advice.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsrr2n/penny_advice/
Thatguyfromdeadpool	1585705058	"&amp;#x200B;

This guide will be short, sweet, and to the point.

First off you have to realize that ""PennyStocks"" or most stocks that are under a few dollars are mostly Pump n Dumps. You will once in awhile find one that is a legit investment on the long term side, but it's RARE.

**Now, What makes a PennyStock ""Magically"" Jump in Price ?**

* News (CT Data, Pandemics(Coronavirus being the newest one))
* A Catalyst (Upcoming clinical Trial Data, Upcoming Events)
* Pump Rooms (Rooms giving false hope of a stock going up, can cause it to go up, who knew, lol)
* Idiots (An example being people thinking the Stock ""ZOOM"" was ""ZM"", Jumped 60$ in a day)

With information I posted in the other thread, you're able to handle the first two bullet points with ease. Now you can either wait for news to come to you, or you can search the globe for what's going on and take advantage of it.

As an example, When COVID-19 hit the world, most of the experienced traders knew what to do. For the ones that play in Large caps like myself, We shorted Companies that would be hit the hardest like Air Travel, Cruises, Resorts, Etc. Now for people in Pennystocks, they knew to keep an eye on Cheap companies that were in the Biotech Field as well as Oil companies that would be affected. You'll notice that once news came out of a possible ""cure"" or ""treatment"" , the stocks jumped up a lot that day.

Keep an eye on what important people say around the world. When Trump talked about Ventilators and how bad we needed them in America, people started to look for pennystocks in that field. Same went for companies that produced masks(Even though 3M has the main contract) and other products that countries were saying they were in need of.

**Now, What if you're a Lazy fuck and only want to concentrate on the charts and not deal with deals ?**

Easy Solution... Watch Volume. This applies to all stocks and I'll show you what I mean.

[https://imgur.com/pDCIicA](https://imgur.com/pDCIicA)

This is a 1YR/1DY chart for ZN and the Blue bars indicate volume.  Notice how Volume is sparse to low, but then once it reaches 0.12, is when Volume starts to pick up.

[https://imgur.com/EiS72iR](https://imgur.com/EiS72iR)

Here's BYND on the same time frame and notice how volume is low and when it starts to pick up more than the average, it ended up ""running""

[https://imgur.com/MKUos3H](https://imgur.com/MKUos3H)

FCEL... As you can see, it can be a good sign to at least Keep an eye on it.

Now following Volume is not 100%, but it's a damn good indicator that something is going on if Volume is suddenly increasing higher and higher. Could be people are loading up for an event or expecting some form of news of coming out.

**Follow others blindly ?**

This Method I do not recommend (Even if some of the mods of this subreddit do it) . However! Keep a watch on what the most popular people on places like Stocktwits and Twitter are talking about. The reality of most of those ""Traders"" is that they are able to get a lot of followers to buy into a stock(either intentional or on accident) and have it start to pump.

Now don't be a sheep and follow , but be a wolf and take advantage of the sheep that do.

**PLEASE REMEMBER!**

Pennystocks are (mostly)meant to be played as Swings(Get in before the pump) or Day Trades. If you get into a Pennystock on a day it's running and you're green as fuck with gains, then PLEASE either scale out some or take profits. It can dump easily in the wee hours of the morning while you're sleeping if you hold overnight and that is not a good thing.

**Good luck to everyone and sorry for the shitty writing, running on no sleep.**"	"A Guide on what to look for in ""Pennystocks"" before they run"	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsq1dm/a_guide_on_what_to_look_for_in_pennystocks_before/

&gt;The first PR about the test exclusivity on 3/10 stated that the first shipment would arrive in 3-4 weeks. Then, on 3/23, their PR stated that it would arrive that week (which was last week). Looking at [import records](https://twitter.com/pakman452/status/1245093701900263427/photo/1)... I see that a cargo ship arrived from Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech last Friday, 3/27, in Los Angeles. Perhaps the other shipments were for other products and not the test for AYTU. If this 3/27 shipment is indeed AYTU'S, perhaps that's the reason for the delay in PR. It does fit with the timeline that they have been consistent with in their PRs. That's my only offer of hope for everyone.

From my calculations sonnet will be about $10 per 1/26 reverse split which will be a loss even at .51 per share.  Would you hold and let your stock transfer or sell?

mysonbo	1585671563	"Interesting information that i have discovered. 

Sabby bought 6 million shares worth $11 million at $1.84. They purchased on 3/12/2020

Armistice capital bought 5 million shares on 3/10/2020. It does not give a price for that but my guess it is close to Sabby's price.

If you do the math, they both are down about $2 million right now because of the drop. 

Now you might ask why aren't they buying more?- The answer is because they probably can't. I'm willing to bet the FDC gave them a date and said: ""You are allowed to buy shares up to this point, after that you aren't allowed"". My guess is because they have insider information, and they know that this will explode in price. 

I think there is no way Sabby and Armistice bought into AYTU blindly and said let's shoot in the dark and see if this stock would hit.

So I‚Äôm new to this whole reddit and stock market thing, but I‚Äôve been doing some research, and based on what people have been saying about these pump and dumps or missing out on something before it gets big, if you miss out on something, short selling should be the way to go, no? Like I‚Äôve seen a lot of fluctuations in the market, especially in these penny stocks, and if I buy high and just wait for it to go down, wouldn‚Äôt that be easier than waiting for it to go up? Or more predictable so to say, seeing what the worlds going through right now?

Now obviously it‚Äôs riskier, cause a stock could go up to 100 bucks or something and you short sold it at $5, but it seems to be an easier way to make money, no?"	Short Selling, is this the way to go?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/frl4dx/short_selling_is_this_the_way_to_go/

Sikspak12	1585508672	"I know this isn't a penny stock related question, but I trust this subreddit than the other subreddits. I am starting to switch over to stocks that pay me to hold them while still doing penny stocks. Of course I still do penny stocks with ones I'm comfortable holding till its time to sell. I'm still new to stocks, 3 months experience, and I'm still learning.  


A few days ago JNUG, a gold ETF, became a penny stock and I notice it has a dividend yield of 3.80. I'm fully aware that ETFs are not meant to be held long term, but I'm not looking for a flip and just to hold it as a dividend investment. I'm planning to hold it for a very long time. Probably for the next few years. Also I don't mind if it goes from 5$ to 9$ mid day, then back down to 5$ since like I said, I'm planning to hold.  


I am just wondering if JNUG would be a good idea to hold long term. Since everything is at a discount right now, and majority of the companies are going back up. (Thank you 2 trillion dollar bill from Friday).

Now some people believe that you need to learn harmonic patterns and candle patterns and all this other shit. It's beneficial for you to learn it, I will agree on that, however we are in the age of the world where technology can do all that basic shit for you.

Here's an example of an ""Indicator"" showing me simple Bear/Bull ABCD patterns. 

 https://imgur.com/cen5qjR 

Need to know the support and resistances of a stock ? Guess what, a simple indicator can easily do that for you.

 https://imgur.com/u15elOK 

You can literally find or create an indicator for any of your needs. You'll hear people that say ""All you need is Rsi and MACD"" ... Those people have never looked at any other indicators imo, considering there are ones that have been made that are way more accurate than both.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what if you don't have TOS and only want to use Webull ? Well, thankfully Webull has a few indicators built in that you can use that will help you.

Although I hate regular MACD, you can still use it to ""hopefully"" avoid being cucked in a trade.

 https://imgur.com/eyQ7f7I 

I'm sure with the above picture, you can see how you could get cucked. Get in at the wrong time and could end bad, get out at the wrong time and it could be even worse. MACD is a ""lagging"" indicator, which is why people pair it with RSI (leading indicator)

 https://imgur.com/eh84vQA 

You can see the benefit and drawback of it from the above picture.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine using something like this indicator that most people overlook.

 https://imgur.com/yxbop2i 

If you were Playing Contracts/Options, You could have easily bought a 200C for this upcoming week for under $100 and sold it for over $1,000.

My recommendation for anyone who is actually reading this shit, learn to use indicators. Every indicator has a set of rules that can differ for the time frame that it's set on. This shit can save you a lot of time and money. RSI and MACD are literally the most basic ones, don't be a fool and blindly follow those."

Best_Instruction	1585429743	"I‚Äôve deliberated for a while when to apportion what has availed me become a consistently remuneratively lucrative trader. The content is nothing more than a collaboration of visual examinations over the past years, from myself, and other traders. If I reverberate myself, I apologize in advance. Let me commence by sharing what initially prompted me to do so. After I read Mike Bellafiore‚Äôs book (runs SMB prop firm) I was PROFOUNDLY daunted and frightened to verbally express the least. Why you might ask? Well, I felt like I see first hand how much time, effort, and focus the best of the best put into trading. I cerebrated I was exerting myself strenuously? Hysterical. You can unequivocally tell these guys take it to the next level. They do everything so sedulously, from reviewing trades, visually examining tape, ameliorating on executions, and these are the guys I‚Äôm up against? It was an eye opening for me. The enormity of prosperity they‚Äôve had is by no means a contingency.

**Trading is...**
-

Trading is hard. It‚Äôs very hard. You‚Äôre constantly competing against the sharpest, most perspicacious human beings/computers in the world, who have deeper pockets, more information, and more experience than you do.You have to battle with yourself, contravene the crowd, what‚Äôs so consciously innate to us, and battle the constant paradoxes that the market so often presents. There are many ways to make money in the market, but they‚Äôre hard to find. See? Paradox. You have to understand your opponents, have a proven game plan, and pick your battles wisely. Ready to play? Find a niche, dominate it, and become the house.

I‚Äôm personally not much of a writer, which is why I have chosen what I feel like is a simpler format below. I truly hope you enjoy, and find something that can help improve your trading.


**Most Common Mistake Traders Make**
-

They get into a comfort zone of always trading the same size regardless of the setup.

* Focusing on mediocre ideas. Mediocre ideas = mediocre results. All they do is take time and focus away from what‚Äôs truly needed to be successful.

* Having a fear of losses. The greatest mistake you can make in trading is to continually fear you will make one. Accept that you will make mistakes. Stop being so afraid of what could go wrong and be excited about what could go right.

* Overtrading. Your goal is to trade well, not often.

* Focusing on money. Your focus early on shouldn‚Äôt be how much money can I make. It should be how can I survive the next 40 years? It takes one trade to ruin it all. Think for a second how many stocks could‚Äôve ruined your life from being stubborn in the past 24 months alone (TNDM, ECYT, I, HEAR, KBIO, ETRM, HTGM, OPNT, KONE, AWX, GBR, ABIL, etc). You say you respect risk, but most truly don‚Äôt, until it‚Äôs too late.


**Books...**
-

Let me start off by saying I‚Äôve read a myriad of investing books. Naively, I was always hoping to get that ‚Äúah ha!‚Äù moment at some point while doing so. Don‚Äôt waste your time.It won‚Äôt happen. It will never be a moment. Rather, you should prepare for a long, strenuous process of making all the mistakes possible. Just be sure to assimilate them, and avoid repeating them in the future.

* Principles (Dalio)
* InsiderBuySuperstocks
* Momo Traders
* Market Wizards
* One Good Trade
---Many of my favorites on this list intertwine markets with a concentrated effort on psychology, and how to think more openly and independently.


**Quotes**
-

I‚Äôve always been someone who has saved trading quotes over the years, as I‚Äôve ingrained many of these in my head, and implemented many of their principles into my trading.

There‚Äôs only one side to a trade, and it‚Äôs not the bull or bear side, rather it‚Äôs the right side. As a trader, you have to decide what‚Äôs more important - being right or making money, because the two aren‚Äôt always synonymous with one another.

**Another thing...**
-

Every time you confront something painful in the market, or life, you are at a potentially important juncture--you have the opportunity to confront the painful truth head on, or you can choose to comfort yourself with delusion and misconception. If you really want to succeed at trading, you will find a way. If you don‚Äôt want to, you‚Äôll find an excuse. It‚Äôs simple, you can make money, or you can make excuses, but you can‚Äôt make both.

* The greatest form of maturity is ownership. Own your mistakes and learn from them. Admit under performance. Understand why. And don‚Äôt repeat it in the future. It‚Äôs hard. Get over it. Adapt or die.

* If you can‚Äôt learn to take a small loss, sooner or later you‚Äôll take the mother of all losses. It‚Äôs not wrong to be wrong, it wrong to STAY wrong! Don‚Äôt cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it. You can never make the same mistake twice. The second time, it‚Äôs a choice.

* You‚Äôre not ‚Äústuck or trapped‚Äù in a position. It‚Äôs just your ego stopping you from making the right decision.

* Great traders understand the difference between seeing a trade and looking for a trade. Remain patient, they will always come, and when they do, it‚Äôs obvious.

* Don‚Äôt be stubborn and fight the frontside of a move. Would you rather fight Mike Tyson in the 1st or 10th round?

* Learning trading means living a few years of your life like most won‚Äôt, so you can spend the rest of your life like most cant.

* Education will make you a living, self-education will make you a fortune. And if you think education is expensive, try ignorance. Everyone‚Äôs born ignorant, but one has to try hard to remain it.

* Stop focusing so much energy on debating people online. Debate them in the marketplace ;)"	i've been thinking about this for a while....	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fqsm9l/ive_been_thinking_about_this_for_a_while/

I could have arguably made a post about this but I didn't want to lead to speculation of FOMO or a potential pump/dump crew, and this isn't my style. Just for fun, when I noticed an odd activity breaking above nearly 0.09 twice, I added 1000 shares, and boy did it break higher highs than normal. Not to mention... hard gap ups &amp; pull backs occasionally. 

For those expecting an answer... the real reason is I am good at catching this often are two reasons: outside bar &amp; a dead float. This is a unique phenomenon, thus someone decided to test a trend and the downtrend turned into a breakout.

LAMOTTO	1585369127	"Hey all, I'm just getting started looking into options and have a question around a basic scenario.

We've all seen a lot of pump and dump price action over the last few weeks/months. Let's take an example where a stock has been pumped extremely high and I feel that it's overvalued and about to come falling back down (flashbacks of CODX \~$17.81)

Let's say on day D that I see it crashing hard from $17.81, and at $17, I decided to **buy a $16 put** 2 days out at D+2.

1. Hypothetically if the price hit **$16.01** and then went back up and never hit $16 during the 2 days, my option would **not** have been exercised, right? Like, it has to hit the strike price and there's no way to exercise before that?
2. If the $16 put is quoted at $3 per share, then it would cost me $300 + some premium to enter this trade, correct? And that's the maximum I can lose?
3. In terms of profit **if the price** **hits $16,** then what- do I only make 100 shares \*($17-$16) = $100 profit?  

   1. Or is the idea that I now own 100 shares of CODX at $16 when I only paid $300 + premium, so I can sell for Profit = 100\*$16 - $300 = $1300?

Thanks for reading this if you're still here... If you have any helpful options resources I'd be happy to take them but please try to answer the questions in addition to just slapping me with a link :) Thanks in advance!"

justasbadasyou	1586987187	"Description:

Endra Life Sciences (NDRA) is a medical device company that is developing a medical device that allows clinicians to monitor tissue composition/function and temperature on individuals at risk for developing Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), and help determine disease stage. This technology is called Thermo-Acoustic Enhanced UltraSound (TAUES). TAUES would be much cheaper than the standard of care (MRI or CT scans) and would be less risky/painful than a Surgical Liver Biopsy. Endra‚Äôs CEO, Francois Michelon, wants Endra Life Sciences to be viewed as a ‚Äúsoftware company, with multiple software applications.‚Äù One implication is that Endra could potentially expand in different markets in the healthcare industry.

Potential 2019-2020 Catalyst

-Potential sales for device
-potential FDA approval with 510(k) clearance
-Adding IP assets (currently at 70), TAUES launch in the EU, and the US.

Financials (as of Sept. 30th, 2019)

-Cash Position: $2.3M, Quarterly Cash burn: $533K (average of Q1-3, 2019)
-Cash Runway: Most likely into 2nd Half of 2020
-No Income

Take On Finances:

Endra manages its cash well. Concerning raising capital, management has expressed a distaste for dilution several times in the past.

Bull Thesis:

Endra has the potential to compete in an expanding market exceeding $1B+. Endra has a partnership with GE Healthcare, the ultrasound market leader, with a 30% market share. The relationship provides multiple advantages, including product development support and access to existing GE customers.
 
In the past, Endra has had problems with overpromising and setting unachievable deadlines to their investors. Additionally, the company had clinical setbacks with finding test subjects.

Bear Thesis:

Although Endra is a promising company, they have a few competitors and obstacles to move through before they can provide this elaborate device to the public. If Endra does not receive an FDA approval and receive a 510 (k) clearance, the outcome will be devastating to the stock price since they need these certifications to sell their device in the US.

Endra is a high-risk investment, but I believe at the closing price on 04/15/2019 of 87 cents, Endra is a strong buy for either a long-term hold or a swing-trade. The upcoming catalysts referenced above are important factors that should impact the stock price significantly. We could also potentially see more insider buys and, financial assistance from GE Healthcare, or collaborations/ partnerships with other NAFLD/NASH companies."

$gldn (more info)

Hi all. Just wanted to update my post from yesterday. I‚Äôll copy it below in case anyone missed it. 

Yesterday Haywood and leedes were the number one buyers on this unusual volume day. They are not your average retail traders like TD, RBC etc. They are big guys. Haywood bought a total of 250k shares and leedes 228k shares. Again this volume is unusual so my guess is people are positioning themselves for what is to come. 

It‚Äôs early this morning but there are some nice bids. I‚Äôm referring tot he Canadian markets of course. Here‚Äôs my post from yesterday. Some good info in there. 


$gldn (gold play)

Check out Golden Resources they are sub .05 cent gold and copper explorer. With gold continuing to skyrocket and the pandemic not looking like it will end soon, money is going to flow into mining plays. 

A lot of gold and silver juniors are moving. $gldn has a stellar gold property in Newfoundland near some profiling gold discoveries. They also have a copper property in the golden triangle which they already hit amazing copper numbers and it ran the stock into the .50s. 

I called $uex last week at .12 with the uranium run with a post on here and it ran to .165 this morning. Look into $gldn. It‚Äôs a great way to take advantage of the moving gold prices and it‚Äôs trading at 4 cents right now. Mike Blady is the ceo and I talked to him before he is super informative and will answer any questions you have I‚Äôm sure as he did with me.

2. The chart is really fucking good.  https://imgur.com/a/yxY1pus

3. the more I watch the price action the more I love this stock. It's just building higher and higher support, and spiked up to .30 quite often in the past on no news. Slow climb, but it looks safe to me for now

TheBazaarTrades	1586918133	"[SCON Chart -](https://ibb.co/SNPcW2P)  a Superconductor Technologies Inc engaged in developing superconducting solutions. In short, wire or wires that perform proactively using 100 times the current capacity as opposed to conventional ones with zero resistance. I for one personally see a major interest in this description alone for a plethora of reasons. Primarily, power outage resistance, short-circuiting, better performance, and of course, better conductivity. What's not to like here? With the upcoming warm days, I can assure you many of us, including myself, are energy hogs when it comes to electricity. 

What intrigued my personal interest with this particular stock is not only the price but also reviewing the previous news going about the merger is in motion though it's not specified when. [The source can be found here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/superconductor-technologies-allied-integral-united-113010438.html) Personally, this would set an unknown price target that may lead to a super explosion breakout depending on this team-up merger these folks are forming with Allied Integral United, Inc. AKA ‚ÄúClearday‚Äù. Clearday appears to be legitimate despite being a privately owned business since I was able to locate both their Address &amp; contact business information. This assures me this isn't some back ally shady corner that would pop up on say things such as google maps.

Getting down to business... I see no downward trend in this chart; meaning it remained support bound at 0.13 &amp; HODL position attractively. Between the 50day &amp; 100day lines intrigue me because it's pointing towards a tighter band, and even more intriguing the trend line is at the edge meaning something is due for the unexpected.

Pros:

EPS steadily improved from Q4-2018 and moved upward firmly Q3-2019 to Q4-2019

Medium float that hasn't fallen below 15mil

PE -0.10 which is pretty fair

PB 2.19 (reasonable for investors)

Oversold to the max

Cons:

Net income low (obviously overly shorted but subject to change).

EPS Rank -1.82

Debunking myths and rumors:

1) Based on reviewing previous news from their past, I don't see a reason why would they submit anymore offering considering the value of the stock is already at its lowest. I also believe it wouldn't make sense to even think otherwise they would if said merger would be concluded unless observing it thereafter at least one week after the said merge. 

2) The most recent concerns that are going around are delisting rumors. Let's go ahead and end this properly so that intrigued investors and holders can move forward calmly and positively. The most recent actual concrete in stone writing anything related to delisting was back in Dec 9th. SCON was in fact was supposed to be delisted prior to Jan 6th, 2020, but it hasn't. Here's why, because they have not exceeded their 180d period to meet SEC expectations to target or exceed $1. So in short... The company said it will monitor its closing bid price and may, if appropriate, consider using available options to regain listing compliance. However! In short ""Under the listing rule, the Company has 45 calendar days, or until January 16, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders' Equity Requirement"" already dismisses the delisting in general since... a plan is already underway.

&amp;#x200B;

Other questions most likely folks are going to ask me are:

1) What's a good entry? 0.17-0.18

2) What do you think is the price target? 0.56. Although after the merger personally it's unknown to me since I don't have enough information about Clearday.

3) If I bought now, what's a safe exit if things were to go south? Minium, 0.16. I do not recommend stop loss. 

4) What's the HODL line currently for day traders? 0.18

5) What confirmation level do you see if it is likely to do a continuation? If it breaks at least 0.24, maintains price strength/volume. Avoid paying attention to premarket except 8 am to 9:45 am."

coinval_co	1586878711	"Hi,

I'm a founder of stockval ([https://stockval.co](https://stockval.co/)).

Stockval is a lightweight realtime stock market price tracker with *anonymous* portfolios and alerts. It's loginless. No personal data. Still, your portfolios and alerts stay on our server and are accessible via a unique URL.

So why stockval? There are hunderds of portfolio trackers out there. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a simple one that would be fast enough, have realtime prices and worked well on all devices. All I found seemed to be extremely bloated.

I've been tweaking stocvkal for over a year. Today, I finally decided to share this lightweight app with you, guys.

Please make sure you try all features, bookmark a customised URL (e.g. [https://stockval.co/10fb/usd](https://stockval.co/10fb/usd) or [https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd](https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd)), create a portfolio, save some alerts, and then share the app with your friends if you like it.

All the feedback is appreciated! Thanks!

P.S. VIDEO that shows all the features: [https://youtu.be/bLBIs9OLfxk](https://youtu.be/bLBIs9OLfxk)

The investigational therapy has not been approved for any indications; for COVID-19, it‚Äôs being proposed as a treatment for mild-to-moderate respiratory complications that occur in patients with the disease. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will test the efficacy and safety of leronlimab in 75 patients.

BucketsofDickFat	1586794848	"As someone who has made a very nice sum of money trading penny stocks, I did the one thing you should not do. 

I was heavily invested in LRSV. Their company had an actual product, they communicated well. 

I originally bought and sold day trading in the .10 -15 range, and finally when it started falling I went all in with almost 115,000 shares at .05. 

Then in September the company went silent. Share price started dropping, but I held... through .04s, 03s.... You get the idea. 

The price today is .0025 

At this point, I'm not even worried about selling. I figure it'll eventually get bought by another company and hopefully make a little run and I'll be able to recoup some. 

I even bragged on the stock here a little. I feel bad for buying into the hype.

OHFTT127	1588337238	"There are a couple lessons to be learned from yesterday's events with UAVS. For the record, I didn't hold a position but I've pretty much watched everything unfold from the sideline. 

Key Takeaways:

1. **Have realistic expectations.** An Amazon partnership was never guaranteed and people that held a position are acting like it was. This was purely speculation from the people on Reddit because someone heard a rumor of a potential partnership with an e-commerce company and each unrealistic thought influenced the next. A partnership could still happen... but with the largest company in the world? Highly unlikely. Be realistic when looking into the future, especially with penny stocks.

2. **Set stop losses.** Many people lost all their potential profit because they got greedy and expected the moon... and then some. The stock multipled by 17x in the last 2 weeks. From a low of $0.30 to a high of $5.15... and it's somehow the company's fault that the trader either lost money, didn't profit as much as they wanted to, or are now bag holding. Stop losses are your friend and if you don't make physical stop losses, set mental stop losses... but in a case where everyone sells off immediately, you'll wish you had made them. 

3. **Take responsibility for your own decisions.** Now everyone is talking shit about the company and the people who run it, even though they really had nothing to do with the trader's decision to risk their own money with a lack of realistic expectations. Traders need to take responsibility for their own decisions. Good or bad. No one is forcing your hand. Do your own research and try not to let others influence you. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. 

--

These are three invaluable lessons that every trader needs to eventually realize and the quicker you grasp these concepts, the better off you'll be. 

That's all for today. Happy trading and have a good weekend!"	Something needs to be said! Everyone can learn from this...	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbhgrw/something_needs_to_be_said_everyone_can_learn/

-Grew 344% in 2019.


-Current market cap is¬†~$20millon.


-Sales target of $10.6million for 2020, on track


-Very green product


-Organic fertilizer increasing fertility of soil, increases water retention, decreases run off, increase plant pest resistance.


-Increased farm productivity replaces demand for new land and thereby HELPS Brazilian forests.


-Increasing productivity by up to 30% over conventional fertilizers.


-increased quality of crops produces, for example coffee beans are grading at a higher quality.¬†


-replaces carbon intensive fertilizers shipped from overseas.


-Is an Essential Services during COVID-19


-Brazilian real/dollar dropping, resulting in cheaper product for Brazilian farmers compared to imports. Will further increase sales for 2020.


-Proven and probable reserves of 777.28 million tonnes. When in full production enough to locally supply Brazil, which is the world's largest importer of fertilizer.


-US¬†$1.98¬†billion NPV.¬†Crazy high. 


It was once as high as $14/share but has languished as they have worked to enter production. They are now in production with increasing sales.  I own shares. The stock has been increasing and if they hit their sales targets the stock is going to do extremely well.


The stock is very thinly traded. If you do decide to invest and you're newer to investing do not but a single large daily order without limits. It will shoot the stock up and you'll miss out on cheaper shares. Take your time and buy smaller batches over a couple weeks, set limits on your order. 


Treat it for what it is, a possible lottery ticket and only invest what you're willing to lose. As far as lottery tickets go I think it's really stinking good odds. Make sure you take your profits."

[This is me trying to trade penny stocks so far](https://imgur.com/855sE59).  I've made a mistake. But I'm back on my feet and ready to try again.  

Mad props to u/co2_druid for his write up [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7z1w7/a_list_of_reminders_for_new_traders/)  

However, I'm left with more questions, and so I figured I'd toss a few out to the r/pennystocks community.  I know some of this information is available online, but it's inconsistent and I want the perspective of you fine folks.  So here goes:

**What % of your investment portfolio should be directed towards high risk investments like penny stocks?**  I know this varies with age- I'm 32, but is there not a minimum emergency and retirement savings as well as safer stocks/indices you should have before taking on more risk in penny stocks?  Is there even a consensus?

**Do you diversify your penny stock portfolio or gamble on one or two at a time?**  I get the sense that the more experienced folks are invested in 5 or more penny stocks at a time.  I find this intimidating and potentially inaccurate.

**How do you find your stock picks?**  If you get your tips from other people's tips, what is their source?  How do I go about finding a winner before everyone else does?  I've been late to the party more than I'd like to admit.

**How can you identify a pump and dump situation?**  And how do you avoid getting burned by one?  Or better yet, take advantage of it? 

**What is the influence of algorithmic trading bots or large financial institutions in the penny stocks arena?** I am unclear on their role in the market, and if I should even care.

Already working with Monster, Red Bull and Clorox. Trading for under a $.05. I bought 10,000 shares. Feel like this is going to boom as we near the commencement of this next 1 year+ marketing contract. 

This isn‚Äôt an overnight short term play. But if you buy now and hold as we near June, I have a feeling massive gains from a percentage standpoint are coming. Their revenue is secured and only going to increase as they use their contracts to secure more contracts. Their resume is growing and so will their revenue. With that, the stock price. A Canadian company dealing in millions of dollars of secured income, trading for less than a nickel.

PradoMV96	1588291260	"VISL, they are a company known for their array of well produced products in the wireless Telecom industry. They have work with a vast majority of companies and the military as well. 

*One of their more recent &amp; great news that has gone under the radar is the immediate recruitment of Jim McGowan as their Vice President &amp; Manager of VISL MiliGov division. This man has decades of experience dealing with military contracts and before joining VISL he was the vice president of FLIR systems, a company that has a $5 Billion dollar market cap. The recruitment of Jim McGowan is going to prove to be very smart business with all the clients he will bring to VISL.
[DD on his recruitmentt](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/23/2005120/0/en/Vislink-Technologies-Appoints-Jim-McGowan-as-Vice-President-and-General-Manager-of-its-MilGov-Business-Unit.html)

*Their recent contract bids that have been accepted. Sure, you can go ahead and say it is a relatively small contract considering the industry they are in, but look at who they are contracted with. It's a small sheriff's department &amp; guess who got them the contract in the first place? **Jim McGowan**. This shows that despite the COVID-19 outbreak, this company is still putting in solid work &amp; after they complete this project, with the help of **Jim McGowan**, they will continue getting government and military contracts. He just barely joined at the end of March and won them this government contract. 
[DD on this contract](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-technologies-wins-a-99285-00-project-to-replace-existing-infrastructure-to-our-new-ciras-6-way-all-integrated-receiver-and-antenna-system-for-sheriffs-department/) 

*Their most recent bid was accepted, thus beating out all the other competitors. As many of you may have heard, VISL was chosen as the company to provide live high definition &amp; uninterrupted video board systems for the Ferrari race series. This is a prestigious contract, this shows that they are clearly capable of making solid supplies in order to even accomplish this. This shows that if the event coordinators believe in their technology, we should too. This contract will certainly turn heads when it comes to bidding on more contracts in the future and it goes to show that this company can work in any industry such as sporting events to military contracts.
[DD on theor most recent contracts contract](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-chosen-to-provide-high-definition-live-on-board-video-systems-for-the-prestigious-european-ferrari-challenge-race-series/)


*Alongside their most recent contracts, if you look their recent history YTD, they are all over the world winning government contract bids &amp; making a name for themselves. With most companies reporting loss in profits, VISL is working hard &amp; continuously beat their competitors due to the quality of their technology.

They will certainly delivery on their next stockholders meeting. This meeting will be on [May 8th](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-technologies-inc-to-hold-remote-annual-meeting-of-stockholders-on-new-date/)

*SEC filings: on 4/23/2020 VISL filed an 8K form, it only be bad if they were going bankrupt, but they are not. This form is directly correlated to DEFA14A they filed on 4/21/2020 which is the shareholders meeting that will take place next Friday, May 8th. This goes to show that they are planning to let the shareholders know some big news, possibly the amount the contract they signed with the coordinators of the Ferrari event or a new contract they are keeping a lid on. Either way, the 8K filing should be good news next Friday. [8K](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14090499&amp;RcvdDate=4/23/2020&amp;CoName=VISLINK%20TECHNOLOGIES,%20INC.&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html)

*In the past two weeks on their company website, they share news of their current contract acquisitions &amp; each time they released something positive, their value flew up (albeit a small change) but still, it's a positive change. [Correlation](https://pasteboard.co/J6gfJAu5.png)

*They currently have a Target price set at $1 and with analysts holding a forecast of a high of $10. I don't believe it will reach $10 on the next 12months, but I strongly believe it will reach a dollar soon and be over a dollar by the end of the year.

At the end of the day, it's a relatively cheap stock, it's trading at 34 cents. You can buy 100 shares right now for 34 dollars right now. I personally bought 200 shares. Because if I'm worng, this will drop back down give or take .25 cents which is where I bought my 200 shares. But if I'm right, then I'll make solid profit. Because it's cheap, I'm okay with purchasing 200 shares.

Anyy, that's my take on VISL. I personally think it's a strong buy &amp; if tomorrow there's a dip, I'll buy more. 

Take care &amp; as always, if you have doubts always do some DD on your own to make sure you're okay with purchasing whatever stock you decide to buy. Gg fellas :)"	DD on VISL	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb7hp1/dd_on_visl/

hansalvato	1588283913	"#  Rigel Pharmaceuticals is a biotech stock that is set to blow.

Their primary product, a drug called Tavalisse treats Chronic immune thrombocytopenia, a horrible autoimmune disorder. Rigel is partnered with Grifols($GRFS) and together they're releasing Tavalisse into Europe in a year, and once this happens, Rigel triggers a 20 million dollar payment from their partner Grifols. When this drug drops into Europe, we can expect the 20 million to help clear up any outstanding debt(which happens with R&amp;D) and they can start clearing more profit from the drug alone and put more money into other ventures.

# COVID-19 Related Profit

We've also seen a company this week that is linked to Rigel announce a Corona virus recovery treatment that is being fast tracked to approval in the UK([Here](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/uks_new_covid-19_trial_initiative_fast-tracks_bergenbios_bemcentinib_1339339)), Bergen Bio and their drug Bemcentinib was actually developed by Rigel and licensed from Rigel, and earns a **35%** royalty on its uses due to a 2011 agreement([Here](https://www.rigel.com/pipeline/partnered-assets/bergenbio/)). What does this mean? Further profit, lower debts, and as we all know what happens with any COVID news, the share prices can moon once the market reflects this data. Rigel is a relatively small stock, which related to the bigger winner here Bergen Bio, but still this will show us positive effects in terms of income and likely news once this conference call occurs on **May 5th Tuesday after market close**.

# Who thinks this is worth buying?

JP Morgan set a price target of **7$** for RIGL, the price has run **up 16%** roughly as of this writing the past week in expectation of positive earnings news, and **84% of the company is owned by institutional investors**, guys who do this for a living, with FMR having 13.55% ownership, Wellington at almost 10%, Blackrock with 8.73%, and Vangaurd at 5.24%. Regardless of your price target, this company sees promise in the eyes of large institutions, and you should see it too.

# What should you do?

Buying and holding shares is one route, another route is doing the longest dated calls, as they're very cheap at the moment, at the current prices, they're a steal, you always have the choice to exercise them, and this is a cheap way to get in now. 

Bonus points: They are in a good position for a buyout as well due to their method of treating thrombocytopenia being one method that can be rotated with others for most efficiency in treating their condition([Here](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/23/what-company-will-eli-lilly-buy-next.aspx))

# TL;DR Rigel is accumulating more income in the next year from Tavalisse with a Europe release, a drug it produced and has royalties on is being fast tracked for COVID-19 treatments, and big investors see potential. All of this with a conference call coming up on May 5th."	The play: $RIGL or Rigel Pharmaceuticals.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb59g8/the_play_rigl_or_rigel_pharmaceuticals/

StreetTripleRider	1588283145	"So I'm putting ""proof"" in quotes because obviously there's nothing of the sort here but there's something odd going on:

1. This is a verified quote taken from the AgEagle website:

&gt; ""announced the expansion of scope for its contracted commercial drone work through the receipt of follow-on purchase orders from a major ecommerce company. Representing significant new revenue, the new purchase orders relate to the continued manufacturing and assembly of drones used for the testing and refining of the client's commercial drone small package delivery vehicles, systems and operations currently in development.""

2. Price skyrocketed in anticipation of the rumours being confirmed on the call today and then tanked when the company didn't mention it at all.

3. A video was found circulating (unlisted on youtube) of an instructional nature  showing how to safely unbox the drones with both the amazon and AgEagle logos, it was allegedly posted on Feb 20th but as the video is down now I can't provide proof of the timestamp, I found this date in a yt comment on a mirror upload video.

I made a shitty screen recording of the mirror before it got removed, you can watch it at 2x speed [here](https://streamable.com/lhorxp) (it's super boring - which imho boosts its legitimacy).

An interesting note about the video other than the obvious amazon logo is the copyright at the end, ""Morgan Chilcott"" who appears to be the daughter of the founder and ceo up until recently.

4. Morgan Chilcott is self-discribed as ""[she] is a visual artist, videographer, photographer, sculptor, editor, designer, and all-around creative."" on her websites' meta data, which is now completely shutdown, see for yourself: https://www.morganchilcott.com/

I was able to find [a screenshot](https://imgshare.io/image/screenshot-20200429-114505-chrome.zbqc6) someone else took of her portfolio before the site went down showing she was the original uploader of the video. My own opinion here is she thought it was harmless and wanted to add it to her portfolio, people found it, combined it with the obvious rumors already circulating and the stock skyrocketed. 

My own takeaway is, this all looks pretty legit and they likely can't talk about it due to NDAs tied to their purchase orders. The video was accidentally leaked by the CEOs daughter and shit hit the fan, the company is now issuing DMCA take-downs left and right to try and plug the leak(s), quite successfully up until now I'd say...

Could this all be an elaborate pump and dump scam? Yes, but the super boring nature of the video and the lack of any marketing finesse would make this a very sophisticated and subtle fraudster. Looks far more like an honest accident to me.  What we do know for sure is the company has legit orders from a ""major ecommerce company"" so even if the video is fake, there's still some substance here.

H2OhYeahh	1588279858	"This post is about the current state of affairs regarding $OZSC. If you are not familiar with it, see my last post on DD here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g9yq5e/ozsc_power_conversion_technologies_inc_reverse/

The high volume the last two trading days has shown that this stock is gaining notoriety, either through pumpers, scanners or posts like this. Needless to say, diluters are taking advantage of the volume, and shares are being added aggressively to the OS count. Just today, about ~6m shares were added, bring the estimate to 115m total OS. According to John from The Waypoint Refinery (IR firm), there remains one DPA to be signed and executed before all dilution is frozen.These notes are assigned to CareBourn Capital, and until debt is paid off or DPAs are signed, the pps will continue to get crushed as buyers absorb these new shares. I trust that the IR firm is working hard to stop this dilution and promptly, as Brian Conway (CEO of Ozop Surgical and The Waypoint Refinery) has stated he is aiming for 100-120m OS. All we can do is wait for an 8K announcing the DPAs, and buy low while we can. 

I will continue to add, as these prices are ridiculously low compared to the potential, and the OS is still low enough to warrant my short term price target of &gt;0.10. The volume these past few days has made it clear that this thing can and will run, and keeping up with dilution necessitates eating up more shares. It doesn't feel good to be absorbing this debt, but I'm playing the game. 

Worst case scenario I can see this OS going to 200m shares. It is common in the OTC world for retail traders to pay for the company's debt through dilutive financing, however after the whole $ELTZ debaucle, I don't think Brian or John from Waypoint want this going that far. They have a responsibility to uphold the already good reputation of a solid company, and want to grow their own firm for the future. They want to represent solid companies, and treat shareholders well so their own reputation as an IR firm can transfer to new clients. It makes very little sense for these guys to risk what they are trying to build. That being said I keep the possibilities open. CareBourn Capital (debt lenders) very well could take their sweet time with their legal staff, diluting away.

bsuav16	1588278853	So if scientific experts are implicating a 14 day quarantine if you have the virus, once the virus is out of your system how long are the asymptomatic symptoms still in the system? Testing needs to be ramped up in a serious way, and we the people should be able to test ourselves. Because then it becomes our civil duty that if we‚Äôre able to bear with the symptoms without being hospitalized, for those who are severely at risk like my mother with Crohn‚Äôs disease, are able to self isolate ourselves with a tool that will guarantee you do not have this virus. I have personally know 2 people that got the virus and how quickly it accelerated to death. This is a very strange thing that no one understands why yet, and as states open because economic failures are going to happen in so many sectors, as they are already, more and more deaths are going to appear all over the country. Because there is no vaccine yet, but we‚Äôre working on it with the most brilliant minds which is great but realistically it‚Äôs going to be 7-12 months without it. Now I‚Äôm not here saying that Decision Diagnostics is the ‚Äúbest test in the world,‚Äù BUT it‚Äôs solution of the idea that you can take the virus onto a level of percentage in the bloodstream, similarly like you take the level of insulin. Until that meter reads 0% you should self isolate.

isaac11117	1588277241	Some people think that this temporary boom in business shouldn‚Äôt affect the stock price and it won‚Äôt go up any more. They think an X sized tanker company won‚Äôt be valued at Y because of a short term spike in business. But I think that could be very wrong. If these tankers profit an extra tens of millions by end of year, they can use those profits to expand their businesses and make them even more valuable. So, although the biggest spikes may be in the medium term(1-3 months) it may maintain a high price due to having all that cash on hand they could buy out other companies or update their fleet, etc.	Theory with tankers	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb369i/theory_with_tankers/

[TTI Chart 1 Outside Bar &lt;3](https://ibb.co/mR5vsRS)

[Chart 2 RobinTrack Supply/Demand](https://ibb.co/fGLDWSj)

[Chart 3 Oversold Proof / HODL](https://ibb.co/PwHbrnT)

So much to say about this. Plenty of room for open opportunity to get into. Highly affordable, support has been consistent at 0.25, broke resistance near closing, and after-hours (0.31). The chart has a gap chance of 0.80+. I'd love to truly be intrigued to get into asap confidently to measure a nova breakout around 0.48. Examining the candles on the left chart, we see a high rise of interest peaking since we all know at this point oil/gas is on the rise for demand eventually should the economy re-open again to its normal flow.

&amp;#x200B;

What is TTI?

An oil &amp; gas company that focuses on completion fluids and associated products and services, water management, production well testing, production, offshore rig cooling, &amp; compression services and equipment.

What's their future? Risk of de-list?

Interestingly enough, the NYSE is being generous extending their continuation multiple times, so I don't see these guys going anywhere.

Legit company?

Yes, though slightly struggling they're a renowned necessity as a global business and address/company contact seems to be legit upon doing a little research.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

At one point, EPS was consistent on the rise for four quarters.

Cheap.

PB: 1.06 again, another perfect analyst intriguing ratio in trader's eyes.

PE -0.27 (just about right which is a perfect signal for entry).

Oversold.

Refuses to drop bellow 0.25 (support).

Cons:

Q1 2020 resulted in dagger fall in the chart. However, this leads to an open opportunity for a swing trade.

Debt to asset ratio of 87.20% though not horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the best entry? 0.30 to 0.25.

bearsareprettycool	1588271569	"As the title states, my earlier post concerning DFLYF that was well received was mistakenly deleted due to the massive cleanup going on. So here's some DD! 

Draganfly (DFLYF) is the oldest drone manufacturer in the world and last week they started a historic partnership with Vital Intelligence and the University of South Australia to conduct pandemic flight tests in Connecticut - the first of its kind in North America.

The stock itself has dipped fairly hard since its peak last week, but it is picking up momentum now. The reason I believe it is a great time to get in is because of their shareholder update call tonight. You can find info about that here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draganfly-host-virtual-only-shareholder-190010557.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draganfly-host-virtual-only-shareholder-190010557.html)

Additionally, earlier today they announced that they had acquired Dronelogics. Dronelogics as a drone company has been in business for 10 years, working closely with large multinational companies to provide insights into inventory metrics, asset management, volume-metric calculation and digitizing assets, among many other applications.

Historically, the stock has surged when PR/shareholder calls have come up. We're seeing increased volume the past two days and for the TSX ticker there's a huge sell wall at .85. Once that breaks it'll be a nice ride up. Granted, anything can happen.

I managed to swing trade a bit today but I'm in heavy again. Since the shareholder call takes place after market closes, I think it's better to be in than out for the open tomorrow!

All that said - DO YOUR OWN DD. Don't rely on other people to do that for you. If you feel fairly confident - then go for it. Personally I think that this is a sure thing and I will be looking to sell off around 15/20% profit. I don't play pennystocks for more than a few days, tops. Good luck."

10:00 am ET April 17, 2020 (Globe Newswire) Print

 via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Patient Access Solutions, Inc. (OTC PINK: PASO), a  provider of technology and management solutions for the healthcare and  financial industries, is proud to update its shareholders: 

Dear Shareholders: 

RE: Merger 

As we previously shared via our Corporate Twitter account, The  Covid-19 Pandemic had a direct impact on the timeline of the  negotiations and pending transaction with the Private Equity represented  Merger Candidate. Throughout this unfortunate pause we continued to  coordinate with our advisors and representation of all parties involved  to assure the opportunity would remain active moving forward. 

We are pleased to announce the process has been restarted with a  target date to have a Letter of Intent (LOI) secured on or before May  29th with closing of the transaction before the end of June. The  adjusted timeline is at the request of the Merger Candidate so as to  secure two final agreements prior to the transaction. The Covid-19  situation that has impacted the world has ironically created an  opportunity to restart the process sooner than was anticipated as Global  M&amp;A for the most part had been suspended."

According to the pr Q1 2020 revenue has grown from just under $16,000 in Q1 2019 to just under $250,000. This represents a growth rate of approximately 1,462%

That is pretty darn impressive, it might just a matter of time b4 the crowd catches wend on this. Currently trading way Undervalued if u base the pps on this last pr.

In recent weeks, oil fell deep into negative territory just days ago thanks to a severe lack of demand, and far too much supply.  Natural gas futures fell on larger than expected builds in inventories along with falling demand. 

 American Energy Partners‚Äô wholly owned subsidiary, Hickman Geological Consulting, LLC has planned for continued growth of their geotechnical services in 2020. As a result, HGC doubled its workforce to meet demand and expansion in the sector. In 2019, HGC saw an expansion of their geotechnical services and this increase has continued into 2020 to the point that the Company must expand to continue to provide the same quality service to our clients.

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainty Hickman Geological Consulting has continued to see growth and opportunity, as well as record sales estimated for Q1, added the company.

Starfish95	1588266710	While some people are kicking themselves I don't think you're in a bad spot. It's common sense to do some research on the stock you're buying. If you did that you'd know that the CEO resignation was announced a few weeks ago..... With that being said, that shouldn't be why you're selling/buying stocks. There still is a partnership happening and whether it is big or small its a partnership none the else so there's still chance for some gains but with that being said we all need to do research before investing because there are a lot of people on here that have no clue what they're talking about and you can't go blaming other people but yourself for listening to them.

bearsareprettycool	1588261376	"I made a post about this two days ago. They're the oldest drone manufacturer in the world and last week they started a historic partnership with Vital Intelligence and the University of South Australia to conduct pandemic flight tests in Connecticut - the first of its kind in North America. 

The stock itself has dipped fairly hard since its peak last week, but it is picking up momentum now. The reason I believe it is a great time to get in is because of their shareholder update call tonight. You can find info about that here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draganfly-host-virtual-only-shareholder-190010557.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draganfly-host-virtual-only-shareholder-190010557.html)

Additionally, a few hours ago they announced that they had acquired Dronelogics. Dronelogics as a drone company has been in business for 10 years, working closely with large multinational companies to provide insights into inventory metrics, asset management, volume-metric calculation and digitizing assets, among many other applications.

Historically, the stock has surged when PR/shareholder calls have come up. We're seeing increased volume the past two days and for the TSX ticker there's a huge sell wall at .85. Once that breaks it'll be a nice ride up. Granted, anything can happen. 

I managed to swing trade a bit today but I'm in heavy again. Since the shareholder call takes place after market closes, I think it's better to be in than out for the open tomorrow! 

All that said - DO YOUR OWN DD. Don't rely on other people to do that for you. If you feel fairly confident - then go for it. Personally I think that this is a sure thing and I will be looking to sell off around 15/20% profit. I don't play pennystocks for more than a few days, tops. Good luck."

imanapple1	1589652925	"So, you‚Äôve heard it in other posts too, but here‚Äôs why I think $CLIS is a great investment leading into June with the start of the app release, and then even after, as it gains steam. Here‚Äôs why...

‚Äî

$CLIS seems to be following the same direction as HQ, and for those of you who don‚Äôt know, HQ trivia was an online trivia game launched in 2017 which had a huge following in a short period of time. Here‚Äôs some stats:




12.8 million HQ Trivia downloads as of August 2018

Peak concurrent HQ Trivia audience is 2.4 million

2.2 million tuned in for an HQ Trivia game hosted by The Rock, 1.7 million for special Nike edition

In January 2018 HQ Trivia topped trivia category in Apple App Store (third in games, and sixth overall)

Highest HQ Trivia prize pot to date is $400,000, coinciding with NBA finals

Biggest individual HQ Trivia winner claimed $50,000


‚Äî


But what were most interested in are the moneys, the numbers, the **BIG BUCKS**


**HQ Trivia valued at $100 million after $15 million Founders Fund investment in March 2018**

**$10 million in HQ Trivia ad sales over 2018**



 
With this whole coronavirus thing going on, and all of the deprived sports watchers sitting at home looking for anything to scratch that sports itch, so viewership will be HUGE, at least for the premiere.

‚Äî

Now that we‚Äôve established the baseline and some numbers, here‚Äôs why you should get in now.

With something this big on the way, it‚Äôs only gonna get hyped more and more as June approaches. While you may be able to capitalize on intraday dips, I think that from here on, the 2 weeks leading up to June 1 will pump the price high because of the increased media attention this thing is gonna get. Even if you get in at .2, this thing is likely to hit upwards of dollars at its peak. Get in while you can.

**TLDR:** Get in ASAP, doesn‚Äôt really matter when, it‚Äôll hit upwards of dollars, and profit is profit.

Eliaslara331	1589643433	"I started two weeks ago but this is probably the greatest advice i‚Äôve been given. My first trade was in MVIS where i ended up with -$400 because I held on too long but since then i‚Äôve been setting my losses at 5% or based on how the graph is. 

I don‚Äôt get attached to the stock, if I don‚Äôt feel comfortable, I get out at my set point, i dont hold on thinking it can bounce back to where it was earlier. Sure, there‚Äôs a chance that it does but there‚Äôs also a chance that it keeps diving even lower, the risk sometimes isnt worth it. 

In the last 2 weeks i‚Äôve made 20 trades &amp; only 8 of those trades were wins but at the end of these two weeks I still came out profitable with +1200, despite losing 400 when i started.

Bullrun98	1589611924	This stock is easily worth $1.50-$2.00, dominating the market share against MARK and others. It has had an absolute fire sale this whole week, as well! I feel really optimistic this upcoming week with this stock. They are working with big companies such as Rotax along with a few others, on the upcoming autonomous system as well as their thermal imaging work with FLIR. This might reach $2.00 in the foreseeable future, so consider this bargain leading into Monday. Long term (years holding, this could reach $5-10+, speculatively speaking). I am not just making up figures, as this company could is contributing with the future of autonomous works. Ford for instance, which has been an absolute disaster trying to produce their own line of autonomous vehicles compared to others. Implementing this system can reduce R&amp;D costs for companies, making it a more attractive contract for automative manufacturers to get involved with, especially since they are chipping out more money on operating expesnes and cannot fund as much for R&amp;D in the meantime. This will cause a reaction, luring other major manufacturers into this technology. Because at this point, very few competitors outside of Tesla, has been able to dominate the automative industry with its self driving cars. So why not lease the patent because it seems like a no-brainer with the level of debt these companies are in. There are a list of other companies that can benefit from implementing this technology into their cars and eventually it will become the norm of society, why? Because CONVENIENCE! People naturally like easier ways of managing their lifestyle and the tiniest changes make a difference to that level of conveniency. This is an absolute sleeper, and I cannot believe I have had the opportunity to hold an average of this stock at .82/share. By the time earnings release (which are expected to be VERY good based on their crazy progression during these harsh economic time), this is going to be back in the dollar land for good, period. And that does not even bring me to the partnership FLIR.... This is an extremely large company that they are now working with, which can only give them more exposure from the press, and from potential shareholders. They have an earnings report next week, which will be very interesting because they have a lot of potential revenue pouring in that is going to be factored into that analysis. This has a very similar set up to MARK, but with that said, it took MARK a bit to really start growing to where it got to its peak based on the thermal imaging aspect along with this company, so it may take a week or two before it gets closer to 1.50-2.00. But hey, many are considering buying into KTOV which price ceiling is what, $1? And it will take two weeks of paytience for the returns most people are aiming for. Bottom point: This is the next swing to get in on for next week. At 79C/share this is an absolute steal to consider adding to your portfolio Monday. I called KTOV for you all last week at a price that would have yielded you 30% gains, this stock can yield better gains and give you comfortability that you are getting in at an amazing price! This stock is one PR away from $1.50, just like KTOV.	How is FRSX still this cheap???

FaithInEnlightenment	1589591625	"This includes me having a super off week! It took me making mistakes and trying to follow different peoples strategies from this subreddit to realize that I needed to pave my own path. 

The key was to use this subreddit to create my watchlist and to find a strategy that worked for me personally. 

A lot of people here chase a hyped up stock or buy because the comments say it‚Äôs a good time. I tried doing that, and rather I got to the party too late, or I bought and had to hold my funds on the same stock for multiple days at a time, which didn‚Äôt work with my impatience. Some people here have patience and they see larger profits from it, and this strategy does work for a lot of people! It‚Äôs just not my cup of tea. 

So instead I will find a hyped up stock from this subreddit that recently had a major drop, but I‚Äôd be careful and try to buy when the stock showed signs that it was getting ready to go back up, even if the increase was marginally less than the first run, then I‚Äôd sell when I felt this increase was at its peak, or when I hit my profit goal (whichever comes first). If I thought a stock was going to continue the decrease for longer than I‚Äôd like to hold based on the indicators Ive learned to read, I‚Äôd avoid it. A bunch of days with small profits is much better for me than risking for a HUGE profit, but it not paying off. 

Premarket dips are my favorite to go for, or dips right when the premarket opens and a bunch of people sell off.

While this strategy doesn‚Äôt necessarily work for everyone, and stocks are a probability game, I found that I‚Äôm much better at this ‚Äúscalping‚Äù strategy than I am at simply just buying what this subreddit tells me to do. 

Anyway, if you get anything from this post, it‚Äôs that if you‚Äôre seeing a consistent loss of profit from this subreddit, CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY! It‚Äôs not a matter of you choosing the wrong stocks, but it‚Äôs that you‚Äôve chosen the wrong strategy for you. Pick something that works for your patience level as well as your level of understanding. 

A very small percentage of people are profitable with penny stocks over the long term, so to be the small percentage that DOES profit, I think you need to stray away from the pack. Doing what most people do won‚Äôt get you consistent profits. 

Sorry for the long post, but I hope this resonates with someone. And if you find that you liked my strategy, please learn the indicators that you feel the most comfortable with before attempting it.

sulphertank	1589584515	"My background:
I have never posted here and only am doing so because I‚Äôve been telling myself for a long time that I would promote this stock when the time has come and I believe now is the best time to bring everything I know to the table for those who like a *riskier but good bet.*

 I have been invested in Zest since 2017. Between myself and reach of acquaintances we have just shy of 1 million shares (this is between several people that all own their own shares). So yes I may come off as a ‚Äúpromoter‚Äù myself or that I‚Äôm just looking to pump this for a short period. Yes my goal here is to make money on my investment but I have obviously been invested in this for a long time and believe it could be a great opportunity.

ZEST:

Zest is traded on the OTCGB market and most people I know use E*TRADE to trade it. Zest has been around for years and patented a technology / device that is placed with fresh produce from the farmer to the grocery store. This device can read information about the produce and maximize the efficiency of the supply chain. It is a product that guarantees a cost savings for major grocers. In addition, Zest has bought out several companies including a recent Oil/Gas company called Banner Midstream. This is important later but for now just think of zest as its original product/tech company but also a holding company. Sources say they did this to support their cash flow as energy typically does. 

In early 2018 Zest entered an agreement with Costco and Walmart. After a short period Walmart cancelled their agreement and launched their own version of this technology and named it Eden Technology. We were baffled when we saw this. As investors, we were thinking WTF?! Did they buy zest or what?! Well shortly after Zest filed a Lawsuit seeking 2 billion from Walmart. We have been following the court filing ever since in which the court trial date was set for June 6, 2020. During this time we saw zest fall from $2.00 to lows of $0.45. 

Throughout the past 2 years we have discussed what a settlement would look like and when it might occur. We have seen several ideas thrown around through court filings that would lead you to believe the case is going well for Zest. I‚Äôd say the biggest red flag was our research about the law firms on behalf of zest. They take large, highly probable cases. One player came in later than particular grabbed our attention that we certainly know would take on the real deal. 

Fast forward to the beginning to mid last week/beginning of this week - an 8-K filing was posted that urged Banner Midstream to finalize conversion to Zest shares. Also, warrants that were issued last year to be exercised into shares. Without going into to much detail it could be suggested that Zest wants to owe less shares through their various agreements because the share price is going to go up soon. We have seen the share price go from .60 to 1.5 and settling back around 1.2 during this time. Then, on Wednesday we see on the court filings that the pre-trial was cancelled. Through our research with law friends, it is strongly suggested that this would be because of a settlement. With the pre-trial being scheduled and canceled on May 21st and the trial date on June 6th, we are more confident than ever that a settlement was made.

We have heard several numbers thrown around including some that the settlement could be more than double the original amount (which was $2 Billion). But we don‚Äôt really know. What we do know is that if a settlement was made for anything close to the $2 billion that the shares would be worth anywhere between $15 - $75 per share. This is obviously speculative, hopes, and wishes, but it is definitely possible. If anyone is interested in a risky bet that I‚Äôve been waiting for years to play out, now is your opportunity."	$ZEST - Ecoark Holdings - After years of waiting I am feeling more confident than ever about this company.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkjs3x/zest_ecoark_holdings_after_years_of_waiting_i_am/

And had the impression that the list was the result of one of these automated webcrawlers that generates a page full of false-positive information.

I looked up a few tickers to experiment: Brown Forman and Jones Soda. I know a little bit about these industries and saw that CSIMarket actually had a pretty good grip on who they did business with. Brown-Forman did business with IO Glass and a Kentucky independent corn growers cooperative. Jones Soda did business with a lemon company, which makes sense considering they bought the rights to an Italian drink called Lemoncocco.

So, **the page for REMARK on CSIMarket is very likely accurate.**

I post this now because MARK has experienced a massive dip at the end of Friday as shareholders flocked to stocks with more immediate promise, and despite clear video evidence there seems to still be people doubting that they're in Wynn hotels.

So, now you have a monday buying opportunity.

My sense of this is that Remark is not in the position to talk about who their clients are or make announcements on their behalf, and their clients won't talk about every single person they do business with. In other words we are going to discover who is doing business with Remark as the ""re-opening"" progresses and sightings of it are stumbled upon."

manniswell	1589571633	"This probably won‚Äôt be seen by a lot of people but to those who see this, or are currently trading with DFFN, or you‚Äôre just looking to invest, here‚Äôs some DD I did in this company. 

First listed as a comment but I felt it post worthy. 



Here‚Äôs some DD on them:


DFFN IS developing new treatments for life-threatening medical conditions by improving the body‚Äôs ability to deliver oxygen to the areas where it is needed most. The company will be evaluating its lead development compound, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC), for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a result of infection with the novel coronavirus. Current treatment options involve supportive care while the lungs heal, which involves oxygen therapy supplied through a ventilator. 


The current coronavirus epidemic is resulting in severe disease for a small percentage of patients, many of which end up on a ventilator as a result of ARDS. This can lead to a hypoxic environment in the patient signified by a low blood oxygen level and subsequent lack of oxygen in vital organs, thus a treatment that can increase oxygenation should help to alleviate these symptoms.


In a model of acute lung injury that mimics ARDS, TSC was shown to increase arterial PO2 immediately after administration without affecting the lungs. 


In a time where ventilators are short stocked, TSC will be a great ventilator alternative. This is all information I was able to find through research. It‚Äôs not a scam like some of these pump and dumps stocks. I believe this company has promise. They‚Äôre showing signs that they‚Äôll continue to grow even after the pandemic is over. I was uncertain at first but I‚Äôm all in now. 


Thank you for your time! Happy trading folks."	Some research I did on DFFN	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkfz2o/some_research_i_did_on_dffn/

StonkSavant19	1589571062	"&gt;**Bionano Genomics to Report First Quarter 2020 Financial Results on June 18, 2020**
&gt;  
&gt;SAN DIEGO, May  14, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bionano Genomics, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNGO), a life sciences instrumentation company that develops and markets Saphyr¬Æ, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection in genome analysis, today announced that the company is relying on the order issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delay the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company plans to file the Form 10-Q and report its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 on June 18, 2020. In addition, due to uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is suspending any guidance, anticipated timelines or other outlooks previously provided for 2020. The company also announced selected preliminary, unaudited, first quarter 2020 financial results and recent key financial and business highlights as summarized below.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWhile we saw an increasing interest in our data and growth in placements of the Saphyr system in the early part of the year, we and our customers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,‚Äù said Erik Holmlin, Ph.D., CEO of Bionano. ‚ÄúWhat began initially as a disruption in China spread across the globe and forced labs using Saphyr to redirect resources to COVID-19 testing or restrict their employees to working off-site, which meant that most Saphyr users were unable to operate their Saphyr instruments and others were unable to take delivery of new instruments. We are adapting to the new challenges brought on by the pandemic and we are seeing new opportunities at the same time. Our operations are fully functional, we are supplying products to customers who are able to receive and use them and we are receiving samples in-house, which we process as part of our commercial services offering. Our sales team is leveraging a number of technologies to reach customers in new ways, and we are finding highly receptive audiences who are learning more about Bionano and how it transforms cytogenetics workflows and reveals previously undetected genomic variations. We are encouraged by the growing level of interest we see and expect it to carry over into momentum in the second half of 2020 when our markets begin to reopen.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;**Preliminary Financial Results**  
&gt;  
&gt;Total revenue of approximately $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.1 million as of March 31, 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The above information is preliminary, subject to adjustment and based solely upon information available to the company as of the date of this press release. The above information is not a comprehensive statement of the company‚Äôs results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and has not been audited, reviewed or compiled by the company‚Äôs independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on this preliminary information, and it should be viewed in the context of all other available information regarding the company‚Äôs results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Recent Financial Highlights**  
&gt;  
&gt;* Received approximately $18.0 million in gross proceeds from public offering completed in April 2020.    
&gt;  
&gt;* Retired $2.9 million of term loan debt in April 2020, for a total retirement of $5.0 million of term loan debt from March through April 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;* Received loan proceeds of approximately $1.8 million pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act in April 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Recent Business Highlights**  
&gt;  
&gt;* Announced the launch of a global network of studies aiming to identify genomic variants that influence COVID-19 disease resistance, sensitivity, disease progression and drug response. The first study will focus on the Wuhan, China outbreak, and will be performed at the site of Wuhan-based Bionano service provider GrandOmics in collaboration with Bionano Genomics.       
&gt;  
&gt;* Announced support of the largest study to date on COVID-19 susceptibility aiming to identify genomic variants and novel active substances that influence resistance or sensitivity to COVID-19 disease progression and drug response.      
&gt;  
&gt;* Announced that the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) to switch its method of clinical molecular testing for patients with presumed Facioscapulphmeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHC) to optical mapping using Bionano‚Äôs Saphyr System. FSHD affects approximately 1 in 10,000 individuals in the United States.      
&gt;  
&gt;* Announced Three Top European Sites adopted Saphyr for cancer, genetics and cytogenetic applications, bringing the total number of Saphyr systems installed at customer sites to 84. The new sites are Curie Institute in Paris, France; NHS Lothian in Edinburgh, Scotland, and MVZ Martinsried in Munich, Germany who have all begun operating Bionano‚Äôs system for genome analysis.     
&gt;  
&gt;* Announced the appointments of Hannah Mamuszka and Yvonne Linney, Ph.D., to its Board of Directors.

DD done by ‚ÄúInformed Observer‚Äù

MARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK‚Äôs intrinsic value.

MARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK‚Äôs shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.

The resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.

The Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company‚Äôs Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK‚Äôs auditor has not resigned and the Company‚Äôs past audits have been qualified with ‚Äúgoing concern‚Äù risk language, so at this point the auditor‚Äôs opinion letter can‚Äôt get much worse‚Ä¶.unless they refuse to provide an opinion‚Ä¶which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.

As we get closer to MARK‚Äôs restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28‚Ä¶.market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company‚Äôs narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company‚Äôs own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization‚Äôs credibility.

MARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company‚Äôs Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company‚Äôs rare and effective official statement of April 30.

It is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK‚Äôs investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK‚Äôs default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK‚Äôs share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).

The value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG‚Äôs lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK‚Äôs current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention."	$MARK - Walmart, Disney, other big names are partnering with this AI Based Thermal Imaging company	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkdadh/mark_walmart_disney_other_big_names_are/

DarklyAdonic	1589560756	"Another day, another SPAC like VTIQ, and another opportunity to make outrageous gains.  FMCI filed a letter of intent stating that they wanted to buy a disruptive food company.  Of course, they didn't identify this company leads to lots of speculation about who the identity of the next Beyond Meat will be.  I decided to do a little research to determine likely candidates. 

Based on the information provided in the letter of intent, I assume that based on the descriptor of disruptive that the company will be producing vegetarian products to replace animal derived products. Additionally, since publicly traded companies could just perform a spin-off, the company being acquired will be privately owned or independent. Finally, since this SPAC is in America, I'm only looking at US based companies.   

After reviewing data from a list of prominent companies in this category here is my ranking for likely targets roughly in order of probability.

Follow Your Heart, privately owned, 50 million in revenue 

Turtle Island Foods (Tofurky) - private company, 47 million in revenue 

Just Inc- 30 million in revenue, privately owned

Before the butcher, privately owned by beef co, acquired June 2019.  Unknown revenue. Might be too small

Impossible foods- too big -90 million revenue

Oatly- no, too big, 88 million revenue

Eden Foods- private company, 29 million in revenue, but not focused on meat/dairy replacement 

Excluded because publicly traded owners:
Lightlife, Boca burger, Morningstar farms, Gardein, Field Roast, Yves veggie cuisine, Sweet Earth Foods, whitewave foods, nayonaise, Daiya foods

Overall, Turtle Island Food and Follow Your Heart seems like the most likely candidates.   While Just is also possible , it really doesn't fit the description of having a broad portfolio of products because it really only sells egg substitute.  Before the Butcher seems a bit small to be a potential target, really only distributing in SoCal  

Tofurky has a variety of meat substitutes up to full holiday roasts primarily composed of Tempeh.  Clearly the less exciting of the two as Tempeh isn't as good of a meat substitute as what Beyond Meat is making.  If this is the company,  I will definitely be selling the hype and closing my positions after announcement. 

On the other hand, Follow Your Heart manufactures vegan dairy substitutes (sour cream, yogurt, cream cheese) as well as vegan mayonnaise.  With this wide variety of products, it forms a niche complimentary to Beyond Meat and has a broad base for potential sales as everyone and their brother wants to try being vegan and load up on this stuff. If this is the company,  I will be holding my positions as there is a good chance this will blow up like BYND

However, given the outrageous current valuation of Beyond Meat, I believe no matter which company it is, the speculation around it will be massive because faux meat/dairy is so fucking hot right now and these warrants will jump once the target company is announced.  It's time to get in early before word gets out and this gets pumped too high like Nikola/VTIQ.  

My position:
3000 FMCIW
Plan to sell after company announcement if company is Turtle Beach Foods, hold through IPO if company is Follow Your Heart

TL;DR 
Likely target is Follow Your Heart or Turtle Island Foods (Tofurky)
Buy FMCIW and wait for the news.  Hold for Follow Your Heart, a possible next BYND, or sell the hype if it turns out to be Turtle Island Foods (a manufacturer of mediocre fake meat)."

all factors that could benedit this military/ aerospace company in the short to mid term. 

**Firan technology group overview**

These products are devices that display information and contain buttons and switches that can be used to input signals into an avionics box or aircraft 

&amp;#x200B;

**BULL CASE :**

1. macro trends: see below 
2. insider buying in the last week 
3. newly open site Circuits Fredericksburg contributed $2.1M in Q1 2020, compared to $0 last year. 
4. Cicuits sales went up 8% from Q1 2019
5.  The drop in sales at existing 	sites was at FTG Circuits Toronto. The lower activity was not due to 	a reduction in orders, and activity recovered towards the end of Q1
6. . (essential business)
7.  market cap 42m,  mrq entreprise value 87m. Fy Sales 113 m (undervalued) 
8. more flexibility than the big players in aerospace
9. The market gap between the tech sector and the other should close sonner than later
10. the stock beat the market since 5 years  


 weak bull asumptions: estimations at 3.50 per share,unmanned aerial sector still uptrending   
  

***Bear case:***     


1. uncertainty 	in the aerospace sector. 
2. (low risk)Hardware sector might get fucked by 5g capacity to cloud
3.  For FTG, overall sales decreased by $0.9M or 3.4% from $25.4M in Q1 2019 to $24.5M in Q1 2020. Q1 earnings were lower than last year, Q2 will be worst. (the market might not care like) 
4. low 	cap, low volume. Ftg taijan chinese division. Major risk here. (See potential for conflict of interest, unwillingness from DoD to fund and seizing by pcc in case of major conflict) 
5. China cutting rare metals supply
6.  Also negatively impacting sales in 	Q1 2020 was the shutdown of FTG‚Äôs operations in Tianjin, China for 	the month of February.  	
7.  For the Aerospace segment, sales 	in Q1 2020 were $8.1M compared to $10.2M in Q1 last year  	 Simulator related sales were down 	$2M in Q1 2020, which impacted all three sites. 
8. Dependency from orders of  	aerospace big players 
9. Smalls margin, 14m net cash only.  	  

 Personal opinion here:RnD may be compromised by china espionage. cybersecurity issues:china is probably already in, intellectual property and patent might have a lesser value because of it.

**An Introduction To TURN** 
 
TURN, or [180 Degree Capital Corp](http://www.180degreecapital.com/#TURN), is an activist firm that works to invest in ""substantially undervalued small, publicly traded companies that have potential for significant turnarounds"" with the goal of creating a ""a reversal in direction for the share prices... I.E., a 180-Degree Turn"". They took over a defunct financial firm called Harris Harris Group, and have done pretty well since.

**What they own**  

So what do they own? A pretty big portfolio. They have a bunch of shit, but notable positions in:

Adesto: Low power memory solutions. These words probably don't make much sense to you but essentially it allows computing with low power. Allowing you to make ""smart"" anything without a huge battery attached to it. Big upcoming tech.

Synacor: Multiplatform developer of internet and video communications shit. What do people need while WuFlu rampages the globe? Internet and video communications services. And with the success of Zoom, there's gonna be a shit ton of start ups that try to get in on the boom, most likely turning to these guys to get them going.

TheStreet: You know that weird website slipping into your google results for whatever weird stocks you're searching? Yeah, that's this thing. Wall street news that actually pops up on a google search. With the massive surge in retail investors, all financial news outlets are gonna be seeing big money. So what if financial news is bullshit? Somebody clicked on it, this thing makes money.

They also have a sizable stake in D-Wave, which is the leading quantum computing firm in the world. They've already churned out a few machines and are researching the topic more.

With all this, you'd expect the stock to be at ATH like the rest of this backwards market. Instead, it's at $1.63 at the time of writing this. And that's after going up 3% today. The chart's pretty busted after the CoronaCrash so it's kinda hard to do TA, if someone is better at that than I am please feel free to put your thoughts in the comments.

**Recent News**  

On May 5th, 2020, TURN sold its life sciences portfolio for $4.4 million. It was valued at $2.2 million on March 31st. Upon the news breaking, the CEO stated ""As long as the transaction closes as expected, we currently expect a 4x to 5x increase to the value of this company in Q2 2020."" [You can read more here](https://ir.180degreecapital.com/press-releases/detail/331/180-degree-capital-corp-life-science-portfolio-company). The stock price jumped up some, but I don't think many people have realized the value here as the company is not very well known. I expect a pretty big run up over the course of Q2 with a jump as earnings are released.

After the deal closed, CEO Kevin Rendino said that ""our current stock price reflects the rest of our private portfolio being valued at nearly zero.‚Äù That was on May 26th, when TURN was at $1.56. It has gone up a little to $1.66 since then, but even that is below the level it was when the deal was first announced. The thing is ready to pump and break out of its upper range around $1.69.

The life sciences portfolio will be pushed out of the company into a sister company with TURN managing the portfolio. This also comes with up to $86 million in rewards given once certain goals are reached.

They also were recently given permission to manage a $25 million dollar pension fund.

The C-Suite has purchased a shit ton of new shares as well. [VP Robert E. Bigelow purchased 51,250 shares](https://theenterpriseleader.com/2020/05/13/robert-e-bigelow-iii-purchases-51250-shares-of-180-degree-capital-corp-nasdaqturn-stock.html) at $1.63 on May 7th, [CEO Kevin Rendino bought 25,000 shares](https://theenterpriseleader.com/2020/05/21/180-degree-capital-corp-nasdaqturn-ceo-kevin-rendino-buys-25000-shares.html) at $1.59 on May 12th. If you look at the chart there have been numerous block buys, such as the 300,000 shares purchased at $1.54 on May 28th. So people are buying into this move.

Some have said they spoke with the ceo and he said because of the contracts in Q1 and start of Q2 they have plenty of money and no RS is coming. I am waiting on an email for this.

‚Äú DFFN Could have a few catalysts early on in the week, and hopefully more this month. Closed on a direct offering at 1.05 before last week and also passed 10 days of compliance at the end of this past Friday, so that could be one early this week. They received an accelerated fda response (26th of may) to their Covid-19 clinical trial program where they plan on using  their novel drug ,TSC (trans sodium crocetinate), to treat hypoxic affected tissues related in covid patients. They did have a spike on after that news but profit takers, shorters, and mm took it down to the 1.20s. Awaiting another study in Romania, which DFFN is teamed up with the University of Virginia in order to obtain info from the euro demographics. This study will take place before the main study in the states , with expected results for the U.S. study expected end of summer.

With all that said, I‚Äôm planning on holding some if not most through the summer. Has a decent covid-19 play behind it with multiple catalysts this month (hopefully). As always, do your DD‚Äù

KingBobo90	1590939725	"I think Leo Pharma will buy out Menlo Therapeutics.

I am betting on Leo Pharma because they are very close to Menlo/Foamix already. They own Finacea foam a product emerged from the Foamix/Bayer cooperation. That's why they have to pay royalties to Foamix. Recently they fought multiple patent infringement cases together and won, at least i guess because they signed license agreements with the defendants, whatever that exactly means, they didn't disclose details.

Only 8% of 2019 revenue from Leo Pharma was from US. I know they had problems with Finacea foam and couldn't sell it for a half year but that's still low. If they want to become a bigger dermatology player Foamix would be the key to it.

More interesting stuff from Leo's annual report: ""The significant increase in spending on research and development activitiesis expected to lead to an operating loss in 2020 of DKK 1.8 -2.0 billion. Further divestments or acquisitions may change the outlook.""

They are expecting an operating loss for 2020 even tho 2019 was their first year with an operating loss. From 2011 to 2018 they always had a win of around 100-200$ million.

An other interesting part of their report: ""To finance the 2025 growth strategy, LEO Pharma secured a EUR 1 billion credit facility from a consortium of Nordic banks in combination with a shareholder loan of EUR 500 million from LEO Holding.""

I guess that means they want to grow aggressively possibly through aquisitions.

Leo already has around 400 employees in US the aquisition of 2 new products and more sales people makes absolutely sense to me. Leo is selling their products in more than 130 countries so they could also get Foamix products appoved in those countries.

I checked Linkedin and found interesting facts. Some people of Foamix worked for Leo Pharma in the past. I made a list of the people and the time when they worked for Leo:

Jeff Zemlak Mid Atlantic Region Manager at Foamix Pharmaceuticals

Dec 2011- Aug 2019

Gilbert Gil Senior Marketing Manager, Pharmaceutical Marketing

Jun 2014- Jun 2019

Stephen Zoffranieri Director, Commercial Operations at Foamix Pharmaceuticals

Jan 2011- may 2016

Vassilis Stakias Vice President of Medical Affairs at Foamix Pharmaceuticals

Jan 2000- oct 2016

Michelle Soranno Project Coordinator, Medical Affairs at Foamix Pharmaceuticals

Aug 2014- dec 2016

Xochitl Jimenez Senior Medical Science Liaison at Foamix Pharmaceuticals

Apr 2012- mar 2019

Iain Stuart Chief Scientific Officer, Head of R&amp;D at Menlo Therapeutics

Nov 2008- oct 2016

Carolyn D'Erasmo Vice President, Sales &amp; Commercial Operations at Foamix

dec 2010- aug 2015

Could be just coincidence but still interesting.

Furthermore in august 2019 Leo exchanged their CEO. They fired the danish Gitte Aabo and the new CEO is Catherine Mazzacco who worked for GE Healthcare in Massachusetts. That is a big increase of international experience for Leo and could mean they want to focus more on the US market.

An other fact is our new CFO Andrew Saik. Linkedin Bio is mentioning: ""During his career Andrew successfully completed over 40 M&amp;A transactions and actively lead or participated in all aspects including due diligence, negotiation, preparations of board materials, and integration planning and execution.""

He already owns 300000 shares of Menlo and could make a lot of money in a buyout like the rest of the management.(CEO owns 1,247,213 shares if Fintel is correct)

There are a lot of other potential companies who could be interested in Menlos's products and that will increase the pressure to finish a buyout fast before other bigger companies show their interest because that will only increase the price.

I would say a buyout for around a billion $ could arrive any day. Foamix technology, patents and products are easily worth that amount of money.

Jefferies virtual conference could be a good place to show our products. That means more pressure for anybody who is interested in Menlo to make a move and try to buy them before others do it.

Menlo will run out of cash end of year i guess so also for them a buyout before that happens would be a good option."	Buyout DD of Menlo Therapeutics	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gu196f/buyout_dd_of_menlo_therapeutics/

04/24/20 H.C Wainright cuts target price from $13 to $2 but maintains it at buy.

Israel loosening virus restrictions so trials for the Check-Cap colorectal cancer screener device will resume in June. Look for that news soon.

The pivotal trial may be pushed back to 2021 but I think that since so many people have not been getting screenings and preventive care that maybe the FDA fast tracks it. It's more patient friendly than a colonoscopy so that might be an extra incentive.

They implemented cost reduction measures including a 15% reduction in salaries for all employees and management and fees of the board of directors. Lowered monthly expenditures by placing a number of operational employees on unpaid leave resulting in the company believing it has enough capital to fund operations to the end of Q3 2020.

Strengthened the balance sheet through a placement total of $16.3 million worth @ $0.60 each ($11.5 million in Registered Direct Offerings and a $4.7 million private placement of ordinary shares) in the first half of 2020.

Breakdown of the Registered Direct Offerings:

04/20/20 A $4 million (before fees and expenses) RDO of 6,666,669 ordinary shares at $0.60 each and unregistered warrants for another 6,666,669 shares. Closed on or about 04/22/20. Stock dropped 47% on that news.

04/30/20 A $4.5 million (before fees and expenses) RDO of 7,500,001 ordinary shares at $0.60 each and unregistered warrants for another 7,500,001 shares. Closed on or about 05/04/20.

05/08/20 A $3 million (before fees and expenses) RDO of 5,000,000 ordinary shares at $0.60 each and unregistered warrants for another 5,000,000 shares. Closed on or about 05/13/20.

05/20/20 Filing shows registration for 20.5 million share common stock offering via selling stakeholders.

03/31/20 Outstanding shares 10,999,719

05/26/20 Outstanding shares 30,171,012

This allows them to continue progressing towards IDE submission with the FDA while getting the C-Scan (preparation-free polyp screening test operated by GE Healthcare) ready for the pivotal 2021 (or sooner if it gets fast tracked) study.

They are also exploring potential collaborations with strategic industry leaders.

Just something to keep an eye on. Selling at a discount to the RDO's. May be putting in a bottom here."	CHEK	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gu02yr/chek/

**Insider Ownership 18.30%**

**Institutional Ownership 34.80%**

Overnight activity

Solid support 0.48

Minimum support average 0.60

Professional price target: $2.1 (math used using debt-equity)

Minimum price target: 1.07

PB 0.20 one of the preferred interesting ratios among traders

PE -0.21 just okay

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

Challenging at a resistance 0.70

The ultimate guide to entering/exiting/dip range.

So, I made a little simple guide for those who spam me with heavy questions when to enter, exit, buying the dip, because...well why not. No one wants to be too late or too soon.

Enter: 0.62

Dip Point: 0.59

Exit point: 1.07 for those wanting to play it safe and close profits

04/24/20 H.C Wainright cuts target price from $13 to $2 but maintains it at buy.

Israel loosening virus restrictions so trials for the Check-Cap colorectal cancer screener device will resume in June. Look for definitive news on that soon.

The pivotal trial may be pushed back to 2021 but I think that since so many people have not been getting screenings and preventive care that maybe the FDA fast tracks it. 

It's more patient friendly than a colonoscopy so that might be an extra incentive.

They implemented cost reduction measures including a 15% reduction in salaries for all employees and management and fees of the board of directors. Lowered monthly expenditures by placing a number of operational employees on unpaid leave resulting in the company believing it has enough capital to fund operations to the end of Q3 2020.

Strengthened the balance sheet through a placement total of $16,3 million worth @ $0.60 each ($11.5 million in Registered Direct Offerings and a $4.7 million private placement of ordinary shares) in the first half of 2020.

Breakdown of RDO offerings:

04/20/20 A $4 million (before fees and expenses) RDO of 6,666,669 ordinary shares at $0.60 each and unregistered warrants for another 6,666,669 shares. Closed on or about 04/22/20. Stock dropped 47% on that news.

04/30/20 A $4.5 million (before fees and expenses) RDO of 7,500,001 ordinary shares at $0.60 each and unregistered warrants for another 7,500,001 shares. Closed on or about 05/04/20.

05/08/20 A $3 million (before fees and expenses) RDO of 5,000,000 ordinary shares at $0.60 each and unregistered warrants for another 5,000,000 shares. Closed on or about 05/13/20.

05/20/20 Filing shows registration for 20.5 million share common stock offering via selling stakeholders.

03/31/20 Outstanding shares 10,999,719

05/26/20 Outstanding shares 30,171,012

This allows them to continue progressing towards IDE submission with the FDA.while getting the C-Scan (preparation-free polyp screening test operated by GE Healthcare) ready for the pivotal 2021 (perhaps sooner if the FDA would fast track it) study.

Here‚Äôs to an investment guide you won‚Äôt forget.¬†This past week, I‚Äôve been observing the stock market for this one specific business that numerous investors are chatting about. If you‚Äôre an investor and you‚Äôre into technologies, then this will be¬†*exciting for you.*

But before we get started with this tech company, let‚Äôs reveal the facts and statistics. Did you know that 55% of computers need repairs within a span of 0 to 3 years? And only 32% of computers 4-6 years will need it. 13% of computers make it past 7+ years without needing repair.

This piece of information is important because we‚Äôre living in a world where we‚Äôre surrounded by technologies and the usage of it is increasing at an unbelievable rate. This is the key reason why I‚Äôm introducing new and potential investors to Quanta, Inc.

With a thriving business for over 30 years,¬†[Quanta, Inc.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.quanta-inc.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1590891380886000&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590891380903000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuAbqHv7HkzMzDdOVi_A28GbQffQ)¬†is a special company that provides professional services that are related to computers and almost anything tech-related. According to the company website, they‚Äôve expanded with a team of specialists from data collection, barcode implementation, to even radio frequency identification technology.

**What‚Äôs the current value of $QNTA and market cap?**

At the time of writing this post (5/29/2020),¬†[$QNTA is at $0.181](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/qnta/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1590891380887000&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590891380904000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHsX0ZerzmSTexYQuW0Gox6se7fQ)¬†for every share and it‚Äôs still continuing to climb its way up the chart. As an investor with a great number of portfolios and looking for a great return on investment, one reason that gives me the signal to move forward with an investment is the market cap. Low market caps are generally signs of being one of the firsts before any spikes in the charts.

Quanta has quite the activity when it comes to press releases and news reports. Within the last thirty days, there‚Äôs nothing but news that‚Äôll take this company to immeasurable steps to the top of the charts.

**Quanta, Inc ($QNTA) Press Releases and News Reports**

We‚Äôre heading towards the end of May 2020, and the Quanta company has announced a number of updates, which shows positive signs for the future of its business. Below are the press releases from Yahoo Finance! for the month of May.

**May 13, 2020**: Quanta‚Äôs¬†[first May announcement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/quanta-announces-significant-advancements-atp-123700746.html%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1590891380888000&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590891380905000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDW1gKQhdutVwpIqKYi3WYSkqwUg)¬†was the data of a different study that measures the result of polarized Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and Alginic Acid in ATP increasing in production. Because of this, it‚Äôs been marked by the company as a milestone because this could lead to many opportunities for releasing it into global markets.

**May 15, 2020**: Another announcement made by Quanta on May 15 which addresses¬†[Francisco Ortiz](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/quanta-names-francisco-ortiz-head-124700989.html%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1590891380888000&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590891380905000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1QjgLaQO1EJn3mB-9vQoHI7ab7w)¬†as the head of sales. The company invested in a valuable team member that could truly shape its future. Francisco Ortiz has accomplished numerous goals in the past with his two decades of experience. Ortiz‚Äôs experiences were direct sales with private businesses and working with medical products.

**May 29, 2020**: Today, $QNTA released the shareholders‚Äô current status and update of the company, which is related to recent¬†[corporate events and SEC filings](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/quanta-shareholder-124700676.html%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1590891380889000&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590891380905000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRStadnU8XoFswsEK6CgoAh7ZuxA). The CEO of Quanta, Eric Rice, made a statement ‚Äúwe have taken several actions to optimize our capital structure, including the refunding of a senior secured debt facility with terms that are more flexible and beneficial to us,‚Äù on the announcement.

Believe it or not, $QNTA will be one of the many portfolios that I‚Äôll be holding on for the many years to come. Within the past week, there have been numerous signs of healthy growth, which signals a perfect opportunity for an investor like me to enter the market. Keep in mind that this is not financial advice, but rather a personal opinion. As a responsible investor, my recommendation is to do your research before making any financial moves."

 It seems to indicate that as May 15th, warrants convertible into 8,715,229 shares of common stock can now be executed at a reduced price: from prices ranging from 3.30 to .30 a share to .21 cents a share.

SurvivorCashGames	1590882863	"I think this is a discussion that needs to be had. I am a reasonably long time lurker of the sub and have definitely seen my share of profits from some of the tickers posted here (PLEASE always do your own DD, no matter how hype a post may seem, if its all positive, it isn't real DD).   


As some background I will admit that I am in a lucky position compared to most, I recently sold one of my houses and ended up with a bit over $100k in liquid capital to play around with, so, I quit my job and took up trading full time after spending several months full-time teaching myself the ins and outs.  


I by no means claim to be an expert and as far as investing goes I am still pretty green, but in my 6 months\~of active trading I am up over 20% and consistently trading a profit each week.  


The biggest issue I see on this sub is that most people have jumped right into this about as recently as me but with little to no research or practice, little to no understanding of the market or terminology and most importantly, NO TRADING STRATEGY!  


This is the big one and what I want to talk about, because I am curious what % of this sub actually have a trading strategy they adhere too? Do you have profit margins? Stop losses? Risk margins? How long do you hold your trades?  


They say 90% of day traders lose money and can you be surprised when it seems nobody wants to spend any time developing a working strategy for themselves and instead just want to blindly gamble on stocks or follow the latest trend. If trading purely on trend and credit post tickers was a way to consistently make money, don't you think EVERYONE would do it? Have some sense and think for yourself, if you want to make money, you need to figure out what works for YOU and implement consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

YOU THERE! HOLDING ALL THOSE BAGS AND TRYING TO SLINK AWAY I SEE YOU, DONT IGNORE ME!

&amp;#x200B;

DEVELOPING A PERSONALISED STRATEGY:  
I think the most important thing to any trading strategy is personalisation, your strategy needs to suit YOU and your own mentality / capital. What trading strategy works for me, will almost definitely not be the same for you, there will likely be similarities, but that's the trick to ensuring you stick to your strategies. Having a touch of personalisation will make it feel like its YOURS, your idea, your strategy and as such you will be more inclined to stick to it (psychology 101).  


Make sure when developing a trading strategy that you WRITE IT DOWN (on paper preferably) then stick it somewhere you can see it constantly. Whenever you are about to open/close a trade, look at your strategy and ask yourself ""Am I following my strategy or am I acting emotionally?"" if you are about to lock in a trade and it doesn't match your trading strategy, its probably a bad trade and your past self is trying to warn you, listen to these warnings to be profitable long term.  


MY PERSONAL TIPS:  
\-Dont't be greedy with your strategy, set a reasonable and achievable goal to start with and make sure you can hit that goal consistently for several weeks/months before altering a trading plan.  


\-Make sure your strategy has stop losses and profit targets in place (THIS IS MASSIVE) give yourself a profit target, be it 5%, 10%, 20% or more and STICK to it. If you are in a position and you hit your target, take the profit and move on. If you really want to continue with that stock, wait for a dip and REAPPLY your strategy, with stop loss and profit target from your new entry point.   
DO NOT START IGNORING YOUR TRADING STRATEGY FOR ANY REASON, AS SOON AS YOU BREAK THE RULE ONCE, YOU WILL DO IT AGAIN AND YOUR STRATEGY IS WORTHLESS.  


MY BASIC PERSONAL STRATEGY: (Take with a grain of salt, develop your own it will be better)  
RISK:  no more than 1% total capital per trade (e.g your total capital is $1000, if you buy 200 shares @ $1, stop loss would be -$10.)  
P/L target: 2:1 profit loss target (e.g total capital $1000, for each -$10 stop loss, have a profit target of $20)  
Time stop: If a position fails to meet P/L target exit one week.  
Entry points: -0.05% below MKT for buy, 0.04% above for sell  
VOLUME: Min 200,000/day  
What works for me may not work for you, but one thins is for sure, you need something that works for you, and you need to STICK TO IT.

Wingz974	1590856320	"New to penny stocks but familiar with reg stocks



-So far my main strategy is stop limit of 10% 
-invest 500-1000 per each
-hold until at least a double or more if the stock has positive news upcoming


But depending on what stock it is should I be setting a sell limit on some if I want just a short term gain? 

I‚Äôm considering mlno/ nerv / mark. And any others I‚Äôm open to interpretation. 

Also - what is a given good range amount ? I want to increase my gains so I‚Äôm thinking at least $500-1000, what amounts do you usually buy and why. Honestly I kind of want to put 2-3k on some but I see the problem if they drop immediately for some reason you lose a huge amount.

ThetaLife	1590852876	"This is going to be a rather short DD so please do your own research but I think that this could easily net profits of 100% plus by the end of 2020. 

Northern Oil and Gas is a company that owns wells to extract fuel in North Dakota/Montana area. Throughout the past 3 years they have expanded their properties and their sec reports show that their net worth has been increasing at an incredible level every year. 

Right now its only at .78 cents a share but this is projected to rise to over 1.5 within the next 52 weeks. And with COVID coming to an end and more people on the road gasoline is going to be as essential as ever. This is also all produced/drilled in the united states so there is no need to import any of it. 

I'm sure that there has been many things that I have overlooked so please look into yourself and tell me what you think. 

Personally I don't have any shares in it as of yet but will probably be investing in it early next week.

Seems like swing trading works well when a buddy system is implemented; many eyes on the same stocks and a stonk salad of multiple skill-sets. 

Daytrading is too time consuming and blue chips lack the thrill of a rapidly moving ticker, so I'm trying to embrace multi-day swings based off psychological factors (the mentality that Penny Stock fundamentals can't be trusted and the technicals are as predictable as my ex-girlfriend's attitude --- a plan to locate a stock with increasing interest and an intention to abandon before the crash).

If we start a small group (keep it more serious - no memes, no jokes, no wsb - just a bunch of investors working together to establish a trading plan and watch out for each other through the corruption). 

I also have some experience writing software, setting up servers, websites etc so i can automate most jobs (though a last-minute look is always recommended). I could also create a webpage to link all serious investors together and share DD / expectations / positions etc.

Cicero1982	1590824252	"Seeing as the weekend is here and we won‚Äôt be trading again for another two days it‚Äôs a good time to reset and begin our research for the following week. To aid you in your research I have posted a guide on completing DD on Penny stocks. 

I tried to put this in an easy to read and understandable format that will maintain everyone‚Äôs attention without all the wonky financial guru talk. Combined with your thirst for making money I am certain it will hold your attention and you will not regret having read it. 

It is my aim to assist new and amateur traders on making informed decisions and conducting actionable analysis that will lead to profitable trades while mitigating, to the greatest extent possible, the risks associated with Penny stocks.  Of course, the first rule of trading penny stocks is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trade penny stocks!‚Äù As you and I both aren‚Äôt following rule one, I humbly submit to you the following :

Risk / Reward Analysis on Micro &amp; Low Cap Securities (Penny Stocks)

1. Overview
2. Catalysts
3. Identifying and Predicting Catalysts
4. Risk
5. Identifying and Predicting Risk
6. Completing your Risk/Reward Analysis
7. Risk Reward Analysis Real Example
8. Risk Reward Outline
9. Conclusion

1. Overview: More and more often I find retail traders new to investing drawn to the highly volatile micro cap community. And who can blame them? A three cent increase on a micro-cap security trading at fifty cents per share will net the trader a 6% return. And who am I to judge? I've made thousands on the rare occasions I could find a penny stock with low relative risk and imminent catalysts. But that is the trick now isn't it? Low risk and promising future price action. By the end of this entry you will know how to assess risk and reward pursuant to conducting DD on micro-caps so you aren't blindsided by easily foreseen obstacles on your path to profitability. 

Note: Due Diligence IS NOT looking at the easily found numbers, stats, and price targets combined with all the good news, patents, and life altering medical pipelines that make a security look attractive. While this information is important, particularly for identifying catalysts, in order to be proper DD you must not only look at the possible risks, but estimate risk probability and why. Only then can you estimate when those risks are most likely to come to fruition. In the penny stock world those risks are only a matter of time. Doing DD by looking at all the good isn't DD; Its confirmation bias. And confirmation bias leads to bad trades. You must do a risk assessment if you are to complete proper DD! .......

- management team  have ample experience developing /selling mines.
-  safest jurisdiction nevada
- When I first saw there was the 450 mil shares outstanding I was going to pass until I took a deeper look...

investment funds own 70% of shares out = 315 mil and they have been funding this all the way since the beginning!! which leaves us with 135 mil shares-12mil¬† owned by management (who have been buying like crazy) leaves about 110mil for us retail folk.¬†


now lets talk about the goods!¬†
Look at Pure Gold mining¬†( current p/p reserves)

Pure gold-----After-tax NPV5% and IRR of $390mil CAD 283USD million and 51%¬† AISC $770USD. fully diluted shares 436mil ..............market cap 452mil. insiders own 30%


WKM---------US$200M NPV5, 65% IRR (100% project, after-tax) US$709 AISC. Fully diluted 439mil with insiders owning 75% shares out!!¬† ¬† ¬†market cap...........46mil!!!!!!!!!!! Low capex first portion of mine will fund second with no dilution

with price diffencial between NPV we should be valued currently at least 7-9 times current SP excluding NSR royaltys.¬†

You can not find a company that is so closely tied to shareholder interests.

3. Misinformation. Some people are here to pump and won't care if you blow your life savings. 
4. Greed. Somewhat tied to volatility.
5. Pump and dump. Somewhat tied to misinformation, but sometimes it's legit. Either way, once it blows the load, it won't make much movement for a while.

(CSE:INDS; OTCQX: INDXF) is a vertically-integrated cannabis company with advanced production capabilities, including cultivation, extraction, manufacturing, brand sales &amp; marketing, and distribution. Founded in 2014 and based in Salinas, California, Indus offers services supporting every step of the supply chain and an extensive portfolio of award-winning brands.

The stock has had a pretty steady climb since March 2020. 

May 28, 2020 they released their 1Q results and you can read that report on their website.

Things that stuck out to me‚Ä¶

They are expanding their facilities. Adding 110,000 square feet will result in harvesting 45,000 pounds annually when the project is done. They harvested in 9,000 pounds in 2019.

Better quality harvests have also resulted in increased potency levels (15-22% in previous quarters vs 22-34% in current levels)

Vivid_Mood	1590793254	"**""This is actually unspeakable that this subreddit has turned into nothing but pumps, what's going on with us?""
-

We are now in a crisis on this subreddit. Our critics are right in many ways. You'd be right that there are many great posts. We have awesome content that sometimes goes unignored. It's a shame that promoters dominate the front page. 

Many of us remember the days where /r/pennystocks wasn't ruled by pumpers. This has all changed. Now our community is dominated by pumpers. There was recently a promoter on here, promoting his subreddit. Several people proved that he asked for positive comments in exchange for cash. The promoter will allegedly pull off the same exit-scam that many other promoters endure. These are the ones people follow DD from. 

Promoters realize the wide audience of reddit. There's many people on here. Look on the sidebar. See how many users are on here now? A promoter sees that number. Knows he can get at least a chunk of them to believe a post. He will sell his shares into you. You may believe your small Robinhood order has no impact. You'd be correct. However, if you had an army of them, it DOES have an impact on the stock price and the promoters know this.

It's important not to get away from strategy. Why are you buying in? What's the reason why it should go higher? Some people come to thinking ""proper DD is the answer."" This is true in many ways, and false in others. For one, DD can sometimes be misleading. Imagine doing weeks of work on a stock, only to realize it'll fail anyway. 

As others have pointed out, DD isn't inherently confirmation bias. However, many users turn it into just that. They specifically write great things about a stock, while dismissing the bad. The bad is what drives down the price. The bad cannot just be ignored. 

The promoter, on his subreddit and a known sock account / scammer, is a great case study. Now we won't mention who this is because no one cares about him. He is yet another charlatan. A snake-oil salesman. He shows up with a fake profile picture. He shows up with ""high quality DD."" As I've pointed out, DD that's excessive and overly positive isn't something to be grateful for, it's something to be suspicious of.

Let me give you an example. Many times promoters, or so-called ""experts"" will set a profit target. This profit target, while sometimes not ""explicitly said"" as a profit target but rather a price estimation, is likely 100%+ the current price. This is a technique, similar in sales, where it's a mental trick to get you to think of a higher price. It doesn't take much reading to discover this. Also using linguistic tricks like ""discover this"" and other various tells are some signs of promotion. How do you know what positive DD is? Sure, it could be long-biased, and I believe the promoters would admit that. If someone has a long-biased, meaning BUYING bias not SHORTING bias, they may see the DD posts differently. 

**How to read nonsense DD**
-

Here are some pointers:

* Only positive DD is bad DD. Assume it's secretly promotion, it probably is

Anytime you read the DD and it's nothing but positive positive positive. Red flag. A normal con-job. Does it work? Rarely.

* Long-bias DD on stocks with a float under 10m if the price is under $1 is likely promotion and should be thrown out

* The longer and more positive the post (DD of a ticker) the more likely it's spam / mass promotion from the company. 

Contrary to popular belief. The more detailed and more positive the DD post, the most sketchy it becomes. You sit there and ask yourself why someone would write a giant positive article about this random cheap pennystock. Suspicious right? 

* DD is misleading - Promoters will deliberately cherry-pick information inside the company in order to create a positive narrative (they are being paid behind the scenes)

* Buying into pump and dumps is a mistake because a pump and dump is determined after the fact, in other words, you never know when the ship has sailed 

* The promoter ""being a nice guy"" isn't a reason to buy. These promoters pull on some peoples heart strings. Using ploys like a dog and their family to con gullible people. These are the bottom of the barrel traders. The worst kind.

Many promoters are running campaigns. They're called promotional campaigns. A known pumper created a subreddit from the users on here. He's apart of a promotional campaign through separate paid venders. No witchhunting though, even though it's been proven by pretty much everyone. 

I suspect one person to write ""but these DD posts don't hurt anything."" Well, it may not hurt you. You're right in believing it won't hurt many people. Although, there will be that one person that'll truly believe these promoters, and lose their money. We're trying to stop that."

chrysler82000	1590776697	"For everyone who got skunked out of 60% of there stock value. I am currently down 62%. There have been many grumblings as to why and how could we lose so much money. I emailed investor relations, Yvonne and Bruce last night requesting an explanation why our shares have lost so much value. They have responded.....

 

Hello Yvonne and Bruce

I'm writing this email to you as a concerned and troubled investor.¬† I'm subscribed into several forums: reddit, stockwits, webull, ragingbull, marketchamelion...... and a few others, and there is quite a bit of negative posts and uncertainties in regards to the investment's made with Ritter and Qualigen. Most of us have lost 30%-80% of our initial investment over the past 6 trading days. This confusion and uncertainty is causing some unrest and stress. Considering this reverse merger has been in motion since early January we are questioning why our investment's have not been protected. The reverse split of 1 for 25 has decimated our stock value. I have to ask, was Qualigen prepared for such a de-evaluation? And if not, why not? The excitement of being part of what seemed at the time to be a value added company to our portfolios has turned into a real crutch. Personally, I am down 62% and I have to ask myself, how long is it going to take to recover from these losses. As an investor why would I even consider investing in you, Qualigen. There wasn't any negative news prior to this merger yet a complete de evaluation. Do you have anything scheduled in the very near future to help re build our confidence with Qualigen. Can you offer me any reason why I would consider keeping my investment with you? Of course any response would be greatly appreciated and I will be sure to post this email and your response on the many forums I am subscribed too. 

Thank you for your email.¬† As mentioned in the press release on Tuesday, the company will be hosting a conference call in the third quarter to provide a company update and answer questions.¬† In the meantime, you can find additional information on Qualigen Therapeutics on their website at [https://www.qualigeninc.com/](https://www.qualigeninc.com/) and detailed information on the merger in the prospectus [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1460702/000149315220006095/form424b3.htm).

If you were a holder on May 22, 2020, you have a contingent value right, or CVR, which is decoupled from the stock trading as QLGN. In the CVR agreement, it states cash payment will be distributed upon ‚ÄúLegacy Monetization‚Äù, which means the sale, license, transfer, spin-off or other monetizing event of all or any part of Ritter‚Äôs Legacy Technology occurring within three years from the closing of the merger.¬† As of Tuesday, the company is trading on the perceived value of Qualigen Therapeutics‚Äô business as it does not intend to carry on Ritter Pharmaceuticals' legacy business.¬† Former Ritter shareholders now own 7.5% of QLGN, following the reverse-merger.

Clearly, I cannot comment on future announcements or press releases.¬† However, management is committed to executing the company‚Äôs business strategy and updating investors with material announcements as appropriate. If you have any specific questions on Qualigen‚Äôs business, please let me know.¬†¬†¬†"	Did you get skunked?

SentientReptile	1578126151	"TL;DR: This morning I was looking at ZN, HUSA, CEI, LLEX, and MCEP and saw that they were all moving up during AH and Premkt. Looked to me like these stocks were set to burst out the gate when the market opened. They didn't. What happened, and why do they all follow the same pattern? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a beginner, so go easy on me. My portfolio is down a couple hundred bucks today after misreading(?) what I thought were promising signs for upward price movement. 

I bought shares of ZN, HUSA, CEI, LLEX, and MCEP today during premarket after seeing 30%+ movement on nearly all of these stocks. My previous experience and observation told me that this meant that when the market opened at 0930, these stocks would be sprinting out the gate. I swear I had a little chub going as I thought about the riches that lay before me. 

I was so hyped that I even bought a couple of calls for $ERX, and $XOP because those were showing good signs (or so I thought) during premarket too. Ugh. Down like $90 on the options alone. 

Because of the movement before the market opened, I thought that meant that these stocks were set to explode. But they all kinda fizzled out or just didnt move once the market opened. Every single one of them follows the same pattern of spiking up 15-30% or so right before the market opened, and then leveling out or declining. 

Can someone explain to me what happened here, and why all of these separate stocks behaved almost identically?"

In the same spirit of my RYU post i thought I would share this stock and post from the TGIF Facebook group. It is a stock that has been on the decline for all of 2019. One big soar spot is the huge extraction facility that should have been done by the end of 2019 looks to be delayed until mid 2020. With out the facility they are near profitability with out it and have cut costs dramatically. They are also one of the few weedstocks with the hard cash to survive the year regardless of the market. It has had major catalysis in the last few months that do not show on the last financials and will be evident in the next financial release:

**Putting things in perspective and evaluate 1933 potential's and more specifically for the next quarter.**

The information listed below all come from the update included in the last quarter's publication, except if mentioned.

1- The next quarter will include the months of November, December and January and will be published at the beginning of April.

2- The sales resulting from the **Tony Hawk** (also and investor) deal have begun on November 4th and will be included in the next quarter's results.

3- **BLONDE** was announced on September 10th 2019 and was on the market for almost half of the last quarter and will be present for all of the next quarter, according to the release of October 22nd, this products is highly in demand.

4- The licence deal with **PLUGplay** was announced on September 19th and was certainly not representative of it's real potential in the results of last quarter that was ending October 31st. If anyone knows the sale availability date, I would like to know. I am under the impression that it will contribute much more in next quarter's results.

5- The first harvest of the 67000sqft was done mid December (approx 450lbs for 2 zones). I don't know how many pounds was produced by the old 12000sqft and if other harvests are planned before the end of the present quarter but, in the end, harvests should be done every 2 weeks. I don't know the treatment time of the harvests (drying, transformation, etc.) to compare the potential but I have no doubt that the moving must have temporarily impacted the production and the last financial results. If someone can let us know a bit more on this topic, could help us do a better DD.

6- **GreenSpectrum** as published on Instagram that they will launch their first product made in collaboration with 1933 in California in January, present quarter ending at the end of said month. Will that affect the earnings? Good question....

7- The vape scandal has negatively impacted sales, a couple studies were made and published since then, proving that the majority of problematic substances were produced and sold on the black market. Maybe we can hope for a little upward move of the sales in the next quarter without hoping for a miracle.

8- Will the second licence agreement with DNA for CBD product announced on December 12th positively impact next quarter ending in January?"	1933 Industries Inc TGIF.CN TGIFF Short term Breakout Predictions	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ej2gz6/1933_industries_inc_tgifcn_tgiff_short_term/

Today they announced that Adam Bierman will step down as the CEO of the company.

This is good for a number of reasons...

1. Adam has been very toxic to Medmen's share price since the IPO a few years ago. His bonuses were ridiculous and his compensation was enormous.
2. He is giving up control of the company by eliminating his and the other co-founders 'super voting shares'
3. Medmen has recently undergone some restructuring which will cut their costs down significantly.
4. With Adam gone and super voting shares gone, this company can start moving forward with a new CEO at the helm.

Not professional advice, and I am currently invested in Medmen $MMNFF $MMEN but I do believe if this company pulls through on the next few Quarterly earnings that we will easily see this between $3-5 per share by late 2020.

SureSpeech5	1580485354	"GUYANA GOLDSTRIKE SIGNS US$9 MILLION GOLD FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Guyana Goldstrike Inc. GYA.V / GYNAF has signed a definitive gold forward purchase agreement dated Jan. 24, 2020, with an arm's-length investor for proceeds of up to $9-million (U.S.) for the Marudi gold project, located in Guyana, South America.

Under the terms of the agreement, the investor will make an initial payment of $2-million (U.S.) on or before April 14, 2020. Thereafter, a second payment of $7-million (U.S.) will be advanced within 30 days of a royalty interest in the project in favour of the investor having been registered.

The agreement is non-dilutive to the company's current share structure as no shares or warrants will be issued to the investor. The proceeds will enable the company to finalize its purchase of the project and further explore and develop the resource potential of the property.

In consideration for providing financing, the company has agreed to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold, representing approximately 10 per cent of the project's current mineral resource estimate (please see mineral resource estimates section herein). Deliveries will commence within 120 days of a declaration of commercial production from the project, or within 36 months of the initial financing under the agreement, whichever is the earlier, with an annual delivery schedule of 3,000 ounces. The company has also agreed to grant the investor a right of first refusal to acquire a further 30,000 ounces of gold, on terms to be negotiated between the parties.

The delivery obligation of the company will be secured by a 12.5-per-cent net smelter return royalty in favour of the investor, to be registered against the project. The royalty will not be payable while the company meets the delivery schedule and will expire once all delivery obligations under the agreement have been satisfied.



GUYANA GOLDSTRIKE SELECTS DRILL TARGETS AT TOUCAN RIDGE DISCOVERY AREA, MARUDI GOLD PROJECT, GUYANA

Guyana Goldstrike Inc. GYA.V / GYNAF has selected drill targets at the Marudi gold project, located in Guyana, South America.

The thing is, it doesn't matter if they end up being the first to provide. They will continue to have more announcements of their progress and upon each announcement they will make the news and the stock will jump.

This is one of those situations where I buy simply to sell off a portion upon the good news days and keep my profits in it. It's basically a free stock at that point. They are also in a good place as far as their refinancing goes.

&gt;Taken together, this positions the company to expand significantly, and hence, dramatically increase the price per share of the stock. In first the first week of April 2019, SURG attempted to break the $1.00 per share target, ultimately losing steam at $0.94 per share. At that time, the company did not have 9,800 retail locations and over $48.7 million in annualized revenues to Surge Network an additional 40,000 locations, and a run rate of $10 million within a single division alone. However, now they do and this time there is a higher number of investors watching as the company can now witness the price of the stock following the growth of the company, which as of 2020, has been exponentially high.

NamSys is a very profitable Canadian based microcap. They offer their Cirreon software package that makes processing cash much more efficient. They are growing revenue 20+% and have 30+% net income margins.

The share price has taken off recently but I still think the company is a buy in the $1.05-$1.15 range. They don't issue any options so there is no dilution to shareholders.

Vaxil Bio Ltd. (VXL.V)  has provided a further update to the company's press release dated Feb. 13, 2020, on the possible identification of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine candidate.

The Vaccine Candidate is based on unique and patent protected signal peptide technology, utilizing Vaxil's proprietary VaxHitTM bioinformatics platform. The Vaccine Candidate's design is also based on successful in vivo experiments testing a tuberculosis signal peptide vaccine. Though significant, this is an early step in identifying a vaccine candidate which must then go through rigorous testing before approval by regulatory authorities.

During the next quarter, Vaxil plans to initiate non-GMP manufacturing. The non-GMP product will be made available for pre-clinical testing by those who express interest and qualify. In addition, Vaxil will explore partnerships and other possibilities to test the vaccine and if successful to bring to patients worldwide as expeditiously as possible

""This is a very early discovery and it is unlikely that there will be a prophylactic vaccine during this season, but we endeavor to have one for future use."" said David Goren, Vaxil's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

ABOUT VAXIL

Vaxil is an Israeli immunotherapy biotech company focused on its novel approach to targeting prominent cancer markers and infectious diseases. Its lead product ImMucin successfully completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma and received orphan drug status from the FDA and EMA. The company continues to develop ImMucintm and is also developing a tuberculosis vaccine / treatment that has demonstrated promising preliminary results with further preclinical evaluation underway at a top US academic and research institution. Additional indications and mAb candidates are under evaluation as immuno-oncology and infectious disease treatments alone and in combination with other treatments."

stokpik	1582043468	"**Key Points**

* Company has passed inflection point to transition to non-dilutive disruptive growth function, with potential to drive $60-80M in annualized sales over coming quarters
* New $30 mobile plan to help foster disruption of established marketplace, realign market leadership and catalyze growth of core SurgePays model
* Many factors not priced properly into shares: $50M wireless revs, Deloitte Fast 500 ranking, compounding exponential growth
* Cash flows from mobile business and Surge Logics will bridge-finance quantum leap to ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù disruptive growth as revolutionary innovator in regional supply chain marketplace

Surge Holdings Inc. (OTCMKTS:SURG) is poised for potentially substantial growth over coming months and over the long-term provided the company manages to translate a spectacular state of current prepotency into actual returns for shareholders over the near and intermediate term.

Perhaps it‚Äôs not uncommon to be able to imagine ‚Äúbig success‚Äù under just the right circumstances for a great many different small-cap publicly-traded companies. But, at present, we believe SURG is a special case: a remarkable situation in which the company has already definitively and possibly irrevocably set in motion the terms for revolutionary growth and success, but the market has yet to reprice the stock proportionately.

In short, SURG shares are undervalued and underappreciated by the market because its recent past is dominated by scaling growth driven by intensive capital needs. But the company‚Äôs recent financial data and its news cycle suggests this phase is now over, and we are seeing the company transition into a new stage of cash-flow positive growth that should translate into a revaluation of its equity.

This is supported by a combination of strong current and coming performance of its Surge Logics segment, dramatic growth in its legacy Surge mobile business, and continued development of its next-generation SurgePays Network, which is the real disruptive story here.

**Coming to a Head**

The most explosive factor in the SURG story is imminent growth potential. According to the company, and from extrapolatable data, we are likely to see continued and accelerating top-line growth from organic and M&amp;A activity that could reach nearly 5,000% on an annualized basis this year across a two-year period. In fact, just looking backward, the company already qualified from the prestigious Deloitte Fast 500 list of the fastest growing technology companies in the US.

But, looking ahead, that growth sprint is likely to accelerate dramatically as the company fully integrates and exploits its recent acquisition of the ECS Prepaid Network, adding over $48.7 million is sales across 9,800 retail locations with significant cross-sell opportunities for other Surge products and services as the prepaid mobile opportunity is graduated into the SurgePays regional supply chain solution.

Before Q4 2019, the stock was weighed down by a sense that the corner hadn‚Äôt yet been turned. Hence, investors were unable to see the light at the end of the development-financing tunnel. However, as we near the end of Q1 2020, there are abundant signals that the corner has been decisively turned, and the light is blinding.

The company‚Äôs Surge Logics segment is set to produce record revenues in Q1 thru Q3, which will, according to the company, help to position operations on a cash-flow-positive ramp as it begins to produce compounding exponential growth by expanding both horizontally and vertically in its SurgePays Network.

**The Big Picture**

The most important point to make for Surge right now is that the big picture model for the company is no longer abstract and theoretical. The strategy is in place and already starting to pay off. The fact that the market hasn‚Äôt noticed it yet should simply speak to the opportunity now present for new investment allocations to the company‚Äôs equity.

Much of this sense springs from the company‚Äôs recent ECS acquisition, which will drive¬†$48.7 million of top line revenue as a simplistic, base-case outcome. But the real meat on the bone here is about the expansion in the network for its SurgePays model, which stands to expand that estimate dramatically because the move also brought in 9,800 new locations ‚Äì that‚Äôs 9,800 new marketplaces that can be exploited and expanded through the precise type of execution that this management team excels at.

The company was built to take advantage of this moment. And the network expansion provides a massive influx of market data: Surge sees all the data from other wireless providers at these locations. Hence, the precise design of its new $30 wireless offering was likely a best-fit strategy culled from that data for establishing dominance in that market.

Another clue here is the fact that the company added a new national sales direction just days after announcing that plan. Folks with those qualifications don‚Äôt step into a role like that unless they can see the prepotency.

That prepotency will potentially drive massive growth in the company‚Äôs mobile segment, which then folds seamlessly into its wider disruptive SurgePays model.

One should note statements from the company‚Äôs CEO to close out last month: look for over $50 million in new Surge Wireless sales. That would be a game-changer. And the stock isn‚Äôt priced for such a shift. But a quick glance at the numbers shows how remarkably easy this may be for the company to achieve: $50 million in annualized sales from new mobile customers boils down to just over $4 million/month. With its new $30/month plan, the company will need 140K new Surge Wireless contracts per month. ECS is doing over 20K transactions every single day, or over 600K/month. If the company nabs just 2% of that, we see that $50 million hit the top-line.¬†

But ‚Äì and this is really the big, big point ‚Äì that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg because those locations then come into the SurgePays Network of supply chain management, and the vertical expansion can take hold from there, and drive those numbers up by 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x, etc.As far as we can see, absolutely none of this growth has been factored into shares of the stock at this point. Hence, even an implausibly worst-case outcome over the next 3-6 month should still represent a game-changing positive shock for SURG."	Surge Holdings, Inc.

The director of IBIO recently obtained 350k shares of IBIO late last year. In January Eastern Capital ltd, a private firm specializing exclusively in investing in biotech companies, obtained a whopping 37 million shares of IBIO. Both insider trades so I've linked the paperwork on the bottom.

So far 4/6 of Eastern's biggest investments have been extremely successful.

They are having a shareholder's meeting tomorrow which could also report positive news as well. They recently published a press release announcing a partnership with a chinese firm, CC-pharming, on the development of a covid-19 vaccine.

They have other drugs in the pipeline as well - an alternative to Rituximab, which is an anticancer/arthritis drug listed by WHO as one of the essential medicines needed by a country. The market for Rituximab is in the billions, and the partnership with cc-pharming opens them up to the massive Chinese market.

CC-pharming is located in Zhongguancun Biomedical Engineering Transformation Center. Further research indicates that this center was opened in 2016 with the backing of the Chinese government, containing state of the art facilities to promote the biomedical sector.

They have terrible revenue history so it's a purely speculative buy, but it may be worth putting a few % of your portfolio into this stock in case it blows up big over the next couple of months. The upside is definitely there imo.

https://ir.ibioinc.com/all-sec-filings?page=1

Still doing some more research on this company so I'll post more if I find any updates.

Update: They recently withdrew a proposal for a reverse stock split. This suggests that the company is confident in their ability to raise revenue as well as maintain share price. A possible recent development inside the company? Definitely a good sign.

Update 2: Congress stuck a deal providing over 7 billion in funds to fight coronavirus. IBIO may be getting some of that funding (their facility was previously funded by DARPA specifically to fight pandemics like the current coronavirus). Still speculation at this point however

Update 3: They recently went on a MASSIVE hiring spree. They went from 8 employees in 2018 up to 55 employees in 2019. This coincides with their recent partnerships in 2019/2020 as well.

They averaged less than 10 employees for the past decade then shot up to 55 in a year. Definitely something huge going on inside that facility.

**Update 4**: They are close to releasing a vaccine for classical swine flu, aka ""pig plague"". Swine flu is a massive problem in China and epidemics can ravage the pig population. IBIO's fastpharming system is specifically suited to making cheap, fast vaccines to deal with swine disease outbreaks. If IBIO can pull off an effective vaccine that is cheap enough to be widely used for pig inoculation this would be a windfall. The chinese pig farming market is China-level massive.

Something to note is that the red tape needed to get a vaccine approved for livestock is much less than what is needed to get approved for humans. If they are truly able to make a cheaper, faster, better classical swine flu vaccine it may be approved a lot sooner than anticipated."

Sun Pacific Holding Corp (OTCMKTS: SNPW) has been on the move in recent days as the Company puts out some much needed press. SNPW recently had dipped briefly into high triple zero land before the recent move up. SNPW has been attracting new shareholders and volume has increased significantly.

On Tuesday SNPW announced its wholly owned subsidiary, Street Smart Outdoor Corp (‚ÄúSSO‚Äù) and InSite Street Media (‚ÄúISM‚Äù) have entered into an initial one year business relationship agreement that will allow ISM to expand outdoor marketing and advertising awareness to increase or boost revenue growth with the Company‚Äôs street furniture panels within SSO‚Äôs Rhode Island and New Jersey markets. Similar to the Company‚Äôs recent agreement with Focus Media Group, Inc., this agreement will also be an awareness, advertising, and marketing program. ISM will act as a third-party sales representative for SSO with the right to submit advertising buys with respect to advertisers.

SNPW has attracted a significant shareholder base and it‚Äôs easy to see why; Sun Pacific has seen large growth through acquisition and has significant funding in place. The Company is also building a cutting edge Medical Recycling Power Plant in Medrcycler, Rhode Island and has a number of large contracts in place that should begin to bear fruition.

Sun Pacific Holding Corp (OTCMKTS: SNPW)¬† is a diversified publicly traded holding company. The Company has a number of subsidiaries including Sun Pacific Power Corp, Street Smart Outdoor Corp, Medrecycler Inc, Bella Electrical LLC, National Mechanical Corp, and Sun Pacific Security Corp.

Company mantra: From the beginning we have continued to build upon our management\`s knowledge and experience.¬† We have focused on our primary mission which is serving our customers and now serving our shareholders. We do that by providing quality service and equipment, working to keep customers satisfied, and by doing our part in protecting the environment with smart green technology.

Bag holders will brag about profits that never existed. They're just praying it goes back up to their break even spots. The market changes all the time yet these same patterns play out again and again for years. Sector plays. Also to any of those who decry my sneaking suspicion of manipulated posts mixed in a bowl of bag holders, I never traded IBIO.

speedingmedicine	1583357447	"The director of IBIO recently obtained 350k shares of IBIO late last year. In January Eastern Capital ltd, a private firm specializing exclusively in investing in biotech companies, obtained a whopping 37 million shares of IBIO. Both insider trades so I've linked the paperwork on the bottom.

So far 4/6 of Eastern's biggest investments have been extremely successful.

They are having a shareholder's meeting tomorrow which could also report positive news as well. They recently published a press release announcing a partnership with a chinese firm, CC-pharming, on the development of a covid-19 vaccine.

They have other drugs in the pipeline as well - an alternative to Rituximab, which is an anticancer/arthritis drug listed by WHO as one of the essential medicines needed by a country. The market for Rituximab is in the billions, and the partnership with cc-pharming opens them up to the massive Chinese market.

CC-pharming is located in Zhongguancun Biomedical Engineering Transformation Center. Further research indicates that this center was opened in 2016 with the backing of the Chinese government, containing state of the art facilities to promote the biomedical sector.

They have terrible revenue history so it's a purely speculative buy, but it may be worth putting a few % of your portfolio into this stock in case it blows up big over the next couple of months. The upside is definitely there imo.

https://ir.ibioinc.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001638599-19-000935/0001638599-19-000935.pdf

https://ir.ibioinc.com/all-sec-filings?page=1

Still doing some more research on this company so I'll post more if I find any updates.

Update: They recently withdrew a proposal for a reverse stock split. This suggests that the company is confident in their ability to raise revenue as well as maintain share price. A possible recent development inside the company? Definitely a good sign.

Update 2: Congress stuck a deal providing over 7 billion in funds to fight coronavirus. IBIO may be getting some of that funding (their facility was previously funded by DARPA specifically to fight pandemics like the current coronavirus). Still speculation at this point however

Update 3: They recently went on a MASSIVE hiring spree. They went from 8 employees in 2018 up to 55 employees in 2019. This coincides with their recent partnerships in 2019/2020 as well.

They averaged less than 10 employees for the past decade then shot up to 55 in a year. Definitely something huge going on inside that facility.

Copy pasting my observations 

&gt; - The founder has a MBA from Stanford. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which means he is intellectually gifted (top 0.1% or better)
&gt; 
&gt; - Which also means he has connections in one of the richest areas in the world, San Fran Bay Area. 
&gt; 
&gt; - He founded Seed-One Ventures, which means if there's anyone who can make this stock moon, he's one of the rare people who can make this happen.
&gt; 
&gt; - He started other companies fundamentally similar to Heatbio 
&gt; 
&gt; Another important observation about the company
&gt; 
&gt; - Senior Business Development Adv has connections in China, Taiwan and Singapore
&gt; 
&gt; - She is in the Board of Directors of Chinese-American Biopharmaceutical Society

Does anyone thing a travel website is going to do WELL in the corona virus?Obviously they wont. Literally they had poor 4th quarter revenue simply due to the coronavirus, and the coronavirus didn't even have a big effect in 4th quarter 2019. Trivago is going downhill and fast.

* Negative earnings in 4th quarter 2019
* Due for MASSIVE losses in earnings in 1st quarter 2019
* Yahoo Finance has it as an overvalued stock (that's the extent of my TA skills)
* Has been in down trend for years

Literally a falling knife stock. I think buying puts is easy way to make some money. My contracts are for $2.5 strike price on 3/20 but if you want to go all in go for anything after their first quarter earnings call on 4/17."

stompingllama	1583332794	"INPX put out their 10-k yesterday, and are touting 68% revenue growth.  It's worth noting that most of that is due to acquiring Jibestream in August, and is therefore not organic growth but acquisition growth that shareholders paid for through dilution.  Accounting for acquisitions, organic growth was about 30%.  Which is great generally speaking, but would put them about 6 years away from profitability.  It's also lower than the 42% CAGR they've been quoting for their industry in their press releases.  Q4 saw them amass $18m in losses on just $1.9m revenues.  This is partly because of a $10.6m debt owed by Sysorex, who have no means of paying back, that was previously listed as an asset.  I wrote that this would (or at least should) happen a couple months ago here: https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/51112064-jdhamilt/5397181-inpixon-corporate-structure-and-fundamentals-point-to-risk-and-overvaluation

Maybe most importantly, and this only shows up in SEC filings as opposed to the newswire, they followed up the ER with a $50m at-the-market offering yesterday.  You can expect they will dilute on every upward move the stock does.  Happy trading!  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1529113/000121390020005329/0001213900-20-005329-index.htm"	Beware INPX bullish revenue number - new offering announced yesterday!	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fddwvz/beware_inpx_bullish_revenue_number_new_offering/
LemonGelato	1583332246	"I  believe I have completely missed out on a fundamental aspect, I'd appreciate your opinions! I won't even mention the stock by name that made me come to this realization (as I'm sure anyone following this sub is tired of hearing about it). 

The basic philosophy of course is to buy low and sell high, but I feel that myself (and a lot of other inexperienced members on this sub, judging from frequent post topics) are going about it in a way that runs counter to the entire strategy of day trading. It doesn't make sense to hold on to stocks that are going down, while hoping for a moonshot. Say you bought at $3, but expect it to eventually shoot to $10, even if that ends up being true you are losing money while holding onto it as it fluctuates between $1-2 all day. If it eventually returns to $3 now you'll break even. BUT, if you had sold (even in one of the dips), you could have made your money back already by buying in the dips and selling at the rises (whereas if you just hold it the whole time, the rises to $2 will still have you at a let loss). 

I see a lot of posts about people ""missing the boat/space-ship/etc."" because they expect a stock to shoot to the moon. People say this while the stock is at $2 and they bought in at $3, when in reality people who haven't even bought yet are in a better position to make money (by buying lower) than the people who bought already. 

My other question is, wouldn't this type of trading be handled well by a computer algorithm? For example, one that could identify a pattern of a stock consistently trading between two points, and then buy/sell automatically? Is there a platform or software that exists, where you could set parameters like these and then just see how it plays out? For example, you could say if X stock falls by X%, buy $100, if rises by X%, sell. Repeat."

pokeking1234567	1583200918	" \####TL;DR and Disclosures  

We think that the safest play is to buy $ALT around $4 or less as soon as possible since the chances of the rocket taking off soon are very high. In the case of options, we would recommend 2020/03/20 $5 for $ALT.  

In the case of $TNXP buying below $1.50 as soon as possible would be recommended and if you want the quick payoff, sell Tuesday AH due to the dilution on Wednesday. However, $TNXP is second in the race for the vaccine so it could very well be a long play. In the case you want to go long, sell Tuesday and buy again on Wednesday for max gains. $TNXP, unfortunately, has no options.  

I currently own around $1000 in $ALT (purchased at 3.80 a share in Friday trading session) and $1500 in $TNXP (purchased PM today at 9:10 am at an average price point of 1.30). $ALT and $TNXT are poised to moon based on both technicals and fundamentals. Screenshots attached for your edification.  

Please guys, remember, investment comes with the risk of loss and I am not advocating any of these positions, simply providing my research.

\[Here are my open positions I currently hold, for transparency\]([https://imgur.com/a/Su51A83](https://imgur.com/a/Su51A83))   

\#Introduction  

Hi, All!  

I go by pokeking and this content is brought to you by the penny stock channel in the WSB Discord. First and foremost, I want to disclose my stake in $ALT and $TNXT. I currently own around $1000 in $ALT (purchased at 3.80 a share in Friday trading session) and $1500 in $TNXT (purchased PM today at 9:10 am at an average price point of 1.30).  

The real reason we‚Äôre bringing you this content today (edited by several members of the group) is that we spent the weekend researching CV penny stock plays and after collective DD. We believe these two stocks are poised for breakouts over the next several days and beyond. These stocks have fundamentals and technicals aligned. I personally spent a lot of time digging through various SEC filings of these NASDAQ publicly listed micro cap stocks and believe their fundamentals are great (I‚Äôm a fundamentals trader myself).  

The first place we started our DD was \[this list\]([https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1](https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1)) that I‚Äôm sure many of you have seen. Around Thursday, we began digging through this list looking for microcap stocks to invest in. Due to some fortuitous twitter action we were able to catch the upswing on $IBIO previous to their 400% moon. As you‚Äôll see in the technical analysis, that‚Äôs most CV stocks‚Äô max. I have no position in $IBIO to close, but they‚Äôre probably not poised for breakout much beyond here based on technicals. I could be wrong, though. All of this could be wrong. However, research under $ALT stocks aligns with this 400% expectation and it‚Äôs the best we got, so that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been going on the basis of.  

From the list, we began our due diligence on 5 companies. I‚Äôm not going to walk you through the list, but it‚Äôs the microcaps listed above. From there, we broke it down and went through all the company‚Äôs SEC Filings, research, and press releases and postulated on which would be best. We then looked at company filings Monday morning. As you can see, I got into $ALT on Friday, postulating that with their investor meeting and 126% price spike to the upside with no pattern before that they still had another 275% gain to the upside potential. They are now lower than when I posted them.  

Also, of note is increased volume in Stocktwits on all of these trades. This implies increased volume as retail investors are taking note of the stock.  

Thanks and enjoy the read!  

\##$TNXP DD  

1. Tonix is second furthest along in progression (behind $10 billion market cap company Moderna) towards the vaccine out of all companies currently in the race as they have been \[working on viral biodefense\]([https://www.tonixpharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1052/tonix-pharmaceuticals-announces-demonstrated-vaccine](https://www.tonixpharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1052/tonix-pharmaceuticals-announces-demonstrated-vaccine)) for years now. \[They have announced a partnership to begin Phase 2B trials in conjunction with Southern Research.\]([https://www.tonixpharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1191/tonix-pharmaceuticals-announces-research-collaboration-with](https://www.tonixpharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1191/tonix-pharmaceuticals-announces-research-collaboration-with)) \*\*\*(Note: $ALT is still looking to establish partnership despite being ready to proceed in Phase B trials)\*\*\*.
2. Tonix is poised for technical break out and likely only didn‚Äôt moon today because of lowered volume today due to Robinhood outages and looming offering set to close on March 3, 2020 for $16,005,000 (14,550,000 common shares @  $1.10) \[Link for article\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tonix-pharmaceuticals-inc-prices-16-134510192.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tonix-pharmaceuticals-inc-prices-16-134510192.html))/\[SEC filing\]([https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13968078&amp;RcvdDate=2/28/2020&amp;CoName=TONIX%20PHARMACEUTICALS%20HOLDING%20CORP.&amp;FormType=424B5&amp;View=html](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13968078&amp;RcvdDate=2/28/2020&amp;CoName=TONIX%20PHARMACEUTICALS%20HOLDING%20CORP.&amp;FormType=424B5&amp;View=html)).  
3. However, of imminent note is Tonix‚Äôs stock deal with MM‚Äôs which means on Wednesday there will be a liquidity event that will dilute stock values significantly. That being said, Tonix is second in the race and at a current valuation of $50 million after capital infusion at a minimum are poised for breakout on the trading day tomorrow. See technical trading explanation under $ALT DD for more details on this.

\##$ALT DD  

A member of the group made a very informative DD presentation, and I‚Äôll be making a TL;DR for it in this section, along with highlighting other sources. \[Link for presentation\]([https://imgur.com/a/RQRXFqz](https://imgur.com/a/RQRXFqz))  

There are 9 basic arguments for $ALT to shoot up from the presentation, however I will be merging some together for the sake of the TL;DR.  

1. **\*\*The Math\*\*:** A member managed to patternize various popping COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) stocks by their charts. It was noted that there is an overnight jump of any X% which would then be followed by another jump of X\^2.1%. The first jump has already happened to $ALT, however the second jump hasn‚Äôt been hit yet. This means that, based on other data points, $ALT could go as high as $8.49. Check the charts from the link if you want the data in front of you. The volume of this stock is also growing, causing bot attention and multiple media sources to mention $ALT.
2. **\*\*Government Funds\*\*:** Trump and Pence have a 2.5 billion dollar plan to curb the outbreak and based on \[this article\]([https://stockpence.com/featured/trump-meeting-pharmaceutical-coronavirus/amp](https://stockpence.com/featured/trump-meeting-pharmaceutical-coronavirus/amp/)), $ALT and $TNXP were present at the White House conference. Along with this, WHO‚Äôs list mentions $ALT or $TNXP as potential partners in this crisis.
3. **\*\*Panic and Bad news about COVID-19\*\*:** The California Bay Area has announced plans for school closures due to the virus outbreak in the Bay. In addition the virus is only going to spread more causing more panic and will draw more investors. The spreading of the virus will not be affected by the economy, so even if we recover, ALT stock will still be hot.
4. **\*\*Cheap Solution\*\*:** $ALT‚Äôs solution for the vaccine is one if the most efficient and cheap since it is a nasal spray. It doesn‚Äôt require a doctor to administer and is very effective especially since the virus is airborne.
5. **\*\*$ALT‚Äôs talk at Cowen\*\***: $ALT had an amazing talk today highlighting their plans for the future along with COVID-19 updates. They also have a couple of multimillion dollar contracts coming up.

\##Technical Analysis:  

* Perfect Bull Flag

\[This means the stock is bullish and we are due for a breakout\]([https://i.imgur.com/jiq4KK2.png](https://i.imgur.com/jiq4KK2.png))

* Pattern With Other Biotech companies

\[Additive boxcar function\]([https://i.imgur.com/jz4wZfi.png](https://i.imgur.com/jz4wZfi.png))

* Example \[$IBIO\]([https://i.imgur.com/TTNMAWZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/TTNMAWZ.png)):
* 1st Jump: 150% (2.5 multiplier increase)
* 2nd Jump: 650% (2.5\^(2.1) multiplier increase)
* Example \[$AIM\]([https://i.imgur.com/tVaWXDg.png](https://i.imgur.com/tVaWXDg.png)):
* 1st Jump: 62% (1.5 multiplier increase)
* 2nd Jump: 176% (1.5\^(2.1) multiplier increase)
* Example \[$MRNA\]([https://i.imgur.com/MzGfe0Q.png](https://i.imgur.com/MzGfe0Q.png)):
* 1st Jump: 20% (1.2 multiplier increase)
* 2nd Jump: 50% (1.2\^(2.2) multiplier increase)
* Example \[$NVAX\]([https://i.imgur.com/uiClNXG.png](https://i.imgur.com/uiClNXG.png)):
* 1st Jump: 15% (1.15 multiplier increase)
* 2nd Jump: 34% (1.15\^(2.1) multiplier increase)
* 3rd Jump: 84% ((1.15\^(2.1))\^(2.1) multiplier increase)
   * Jumps always follow the math. $ALT is currently trading around $3. Trading at about 90% more than what it‚Äôs been averaging at for the last 6 months. It will be trading at 1.9\^2.1 = 3.84 =&gt; 284% more than what it was. This is equal to over $8 (possibly higher with the news that‚Äôs been coming out).
* The volume for Altimmune is steadily increasing. Showing large momentum for the value of the stock. $ALT is not slowing down.
* 2020/03/20 $5 call options for $ALT are decreasing (less than 100 now). 2020/04/17 $5 call options for $ALT are \*\***sold out\*\***.  

\###Altimmune Press:  

1. Government Funding

* As of 2020/02/28 the US government made the announcement that there is an urgent \[$2.5b plan\]([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-white-house-2-5-billion-plan-vaccine-congress-funding/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-white-house-2-5-billion-plan-vaccine-congress-funding/)) to address the coronavirus outbreak. This number has only increased since the release of the news.

1. Altimmune had a set of \[slides\]([http://wsw.com/webcast/cowen57/alt/index.aspx](http://wsw.com/webcast/cowen57/alt/index.aspx)) detailing their work on the coronavirus at the Cowen 40th annual health care conference. The company has made this one of their top priorities and are pushing deadlines hard.
2. Coronavirus is a respiratory pathogen. Altimmune‚Äôs nasovax solution directly protects the respiratory system while also administering the vaccine.
3. Altimmune has the cheapest vaccine solution. Our healthcare system could be totally swamped while professional doctors are requested to administer injections. Cheap = more = higher stocks for $ALT.
4. The quick and widespread fear of coronavirus is causing things such as potential \[school closures\]([https://calmatters.org/health/2020/02/california-students-coronavirus-disruption-schools-colleges-online-learning/](https://calmatters.org/health/2020/02/california-students-coronavirus-disruption-schools-colleges-online-learning/)) while the coronavirus is in effect.
5. Altimmune has already gotten the \[go-ahead for trials\]([https://time.com/5790545/first-covid-19-vaccine/](https://time.com/5790545/first-covid-19-vaccine/)).
6. While not life threatening, that doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt cause panic. As the virus continues to spread, people will get \[more worried\]([https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/number-of-coronavirus-cases-from-unknown-source-growing-in-us/ar-BB10ygJK?ocid=st2](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/number-of-coronavirus-cases-from-unknown-source-growing-in-us/ar-BB10ygJK?ocid=st2)).
7. There are all these bear/bull fights going on over $SPY. It doesn‚Äôt matter what happens with the overall market, coronavirus is the constant, and Altimmune will go up regardless. It‚Äôs a much safer play.
8. Analysts \[rank stock at over $13\]([https://i.imgur.com/yHTTDF9.png](https://i.imgur.com/yHTTDF9.png)).
9. Bots run 60% of the stock market (arguably more). They pay attention to the news and use them in their algorithms. Altimmune has been \*\***all over\*\*** the news.
10. On 2020/02/29 the WHO announced a draft list for companies that would work on the vaccine. \[Altimmune is on that list\]([https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1](https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1)). \*I cover this in my introduction
11. On 2020/03/02 President Trump met with Altimmune (as well as a few other companies) to \[discuss the vaccines and possible cures\]([https://stockpence.com/featured/trump-meeting-pharmaceutical-coronavirus/amp/](https://stockpence.com/featured/trump-meeting-pharmaceutical-coronavirus/amp/))."

Been all over the canadian IPOs of MMED and SHRM. 

Strong user and believer of the products of MMED and shark tanks Kevin O'Leary is in very early on it. My money is on this one to do the best.

SHRM I bought to stay ontop of the industry. Still got DD to dig up.

I think with how pot stocks soared early, it's a chance to set and forget these stocks. Especially seeing as magic mushrooms and lsd are finally getting the unbiased attention from the medical sector that it deserves. Ibogaine is like a hard reset when it comes to addictions and lsd has so many benefits in small doses.

LITT is another one I threw a hundred dollars at, but not expecting too much.

Compass pathways is an IPO I am waiting on as well

arch1inc	1583849689	"$ALPP is currently trading on the OTCQB at .065 as of this post with a market cap of $7.46 million. This is 4x under reported revenue for 2019, and 6x under 2020 revenue. Q3 was a big turning point for ALPP in that they had their first net positive quarter by 2.6 million (yes that much) in a while. More cash flow, growing revenues and organic growth, nyse uplist, debt being paid off weekly, no dilution are all reasons to invest in ALPP this low. Current book price of $ALPP is $.48

Year over year revenue increased 96% from 2018 to 2019, and revenue from 2 aquisitions (1 late 2019 and 1 january 2020) has already increased revenue by 22 million for 2020 putting ALPP at a total revenue of around $50 million. CEO Kent in the 2019 end of year shareholder letter mentions 1-2 more aquisitions by end of year adding $15-40 million more in revenue. 

NYSE UPLIST:
S-1 has already been filed, a first step in uplisting to the NYSE. 2 (TWO) investment banks have been signed on and are invested in helping $ALPP uplist. This is a very good sign, especially because investment banks get better access to financials and have great insight on long term growth of a stock. ALPP has already committed to the benchmark investment conference march 19th (which may be cancelled due to coronavirus unfortunately), and another investment meeting late march. Roadshow for investors has begun! 

DIVIDEND: 
July 2019, ALPP issued a 1-10 share divident (for every 10 shares you owned you recieved 1). This is incredibly rare on the OTC! CEO kent mentions in his stock day podcast intervew AND shareholder letter that ALPP plans to reward investors through the uplist process with another share dividend immediatelly after.

REVERSE SPLIT:
Many times on the OTC markets a Reverse Split (r/s) is seen as bad (more dilution). However, in the case of ALPP the split will be used just to uplist. This means that the higher the stock price prior to uplisting the lower the r/s or no r/s at all even. (I.e if we have a .50$ stock price we will only need a 1-4 r/s to meet NYSE requirements). A r/s does NOT lose shareholders value when the company has strong fundamentals with NO dilution, GROWING revenues, expanding cash flow, NET POSITIVE fins. 

ALPP has no convertible debt, which means no dilution.

**- Update covers all MEG-related announcements to date**  
**- Details progress in all key operational and revenue-generating areas**  
**- Provides transparency as China recovers from Coronavirus impact**

 

NEW YORK, March 10, 2020 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ --¬†[Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2745651-1&amp;h=202550487&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics),¬†(NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced a detailed update to its Mobile Energy Global (""MEG"") activities, including the impact of the Coronavirus on its Q1 activities.

In general, Chinese companies returned to work at the start of March with most major commercial activities slowly getting back to normal. MEG's partners have been impacted to varying degrees and recent conversations have shown there is a resolute effort being made to recover quickly from the effects of the outbreak. Currently, there¬†are no details available for any government stimulus programs to help the Chinese economy recover from the shutdown, so we are unable to determine what participation opportunities, if any, may be available to Ideanomics and MEG.

**A: Financing / Funding for Fleet Purchasing**

In September 2018, Ideanomics announced its agreement with First Auto Loan, regarding lease financing and ABS products with a target of raising $6 Billion to fund the lease financing of ride-share vehicles and other types of app-requested taxis. This agreement is currently in progress and will benefit from the capital sourcing referenced below.

In November and December of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced the creation of multiple funds in association with Dasheng Licheng Lease Financing, with Ideanomics bringing in several high-profile insurance companies to provide large-scale funds to support EV lease financing programs. The final province-level registrations were underway when the outbreak occurred and are now back underway. The impact on bringing these funds to market will now extend into Q2 but should otherwise remain unaffected.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an agreement with China's Yunnan province which included lease financing for the heavy truck segment, with backing by AAA-rated province-specific entities in conjunction with MEG's lease financing programs. The deal also provided for investment into charging station infrastructure, as well as investment into Treeletrik via Yunnan's role as the ASEAN region's belt and road sponsor. The shutdown impacted the timing on this, particularly as it pertained to final registration and approvals at local government, but is expected to be reinstated in the near term.

**B: EV and EV Battery Manufacturing Alliance**

Over the course of the past 18 months or so, Ideanomics, and subsequently MEG, has partnered with leading EV and EV Battery manufacturers, including JAC, Geely, Beijing Foton, CATL, and Yinlong, among others. These partnerships are an important part of the overall offering and assist MEG in offering competitive procurement and order fulfillment. Having best-in-class partners ensures we can meet the needs of fleet operators in terms of vehicle specifications, quality, reliability, and cost and continue to attract large-scale order interest.

As part of the commencement of activities in Qingdao, we will be showcasing many of these partners at our EV sales hub and anticipate additional manufacturing partners participating based on their value to the overall offering.

We had begun to implement a joint marketing strategy with select partners, including our participation with CATL in the now postponed EV Mining event in Stockholm, Sweden on March 18-20. It has been tentatively rescheduled until November of this year, due to Coronavirus concerns.

**C. Joint Ventures and Other Strategic and Umbrella Agreements**

Ideanomics and MEG has announced several agreements as either joint ventures, strategic partnerships, or umbrella agreements, which form part of MEG's business development and revenue pipeline development activities. These include deals with the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for MEG involvement in supporting the transition to EV mining, which we anticipate will be a significant revenue division for our organization; Zhitong 3000, where we intend to offer their fleet customers' MEG services; activities securing relationships with tourism associations to develop EV tour bus revenues; and more. Each of these is progressing in the normal course of business in the context of earlier sections of this update and, in particular, section A as it pertains to lease financing services.

**D: Sales Agreements for Execution**

In August of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with iUnicorn, to procure and finance 90,000 taxis for the city of Chengdu, in addition to other cities. In September of 2019, MEG announced the delivery of an additional 4,127 taxis, with confirmation of a further 11,000 to be delivered by the end of 2019. These are subject to the return of local government, to process the final rebate and registration approvals. We anticipate this occurring when the spring temperatures reduce the impact of the outbreak and cities return to normal levels of commerce and the resulting demand for public transportation is restored to pre-outbreak levels.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an order from Yunnan province for 35,000 taxis, and an additional order for 2,300 taxis from the city of Guillin, in Guanxi province. Both of these orders are delayed due to the closure of non-essential local government services, which we anticipate returning to normal in a similar manner to the iUnicorn JV.

In addition to the sales agreements mentioned above, the MEG team has developed a diverse pipeline of sales orders, with interest and activities in all four of its EV revenue divisions of Heavy Trucks, Buses and Coaches, Logistical Vehicles, and Taxis. In lieu of the lease financing funds availability, MEG has been pursuing bespoke financing for each order, respectively. Furthermore, the recently announced Qingdao sales center activities will help further augment sales going forward.

**E. Global EV Sales Expansion**

In March of 2019, Ideanomics announced the acquisition of 51% of Malaysia-based EV manufacturer and distributor, Treeletrik. Since the acquisition, Treeletrik has hired an experienced CEO from the automotive industry, increased its sales and after sales operations, upgraded the land secured under the acquisition from leasehold to title holder, secured orders elsewhere in the ASEAN region, and is in negotiations to bring in a number of Chinese EV manufacturing and EV battery partners to help round out its KD and assembly activities such that it can scale its supply operations to ensure order fulfilment.

Outside of Asia, MEG has received some preliminary order inquiries in the Middle East and plans to broadly expand its global footprint once all of its China-based activities are under way.

**F: Energy Sales**

MEG's core strategy is to acquire fleet customers, through offering innovative and cost-efficient transition to EV, such that we transition the consumption of energy from Gasoline and Diesel onto cleaner Electricity. MEG has signed numerous joint venture and strategic partnership agreements to help develop its relationships in this regard and plans to sell both pre-paid electricity at a discount to fleet operators, as well as participate in the lucrative EV charging market. Each of these is valid and in process for normal course of business, with the major highlights detailed below.

In July of 2019, Ideanomics announced agreements with Three Gorges, to include Tianda Energy and Ding Fang, and Palcan Energy to finance and develop EV fast charging networks. MEG has continued to explore these and other EV fast charging technologies, including those from our EV battery partners, as detailed in the PetroChina update below.

In September 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with PetroChina, to begin a project to repurpose gas stations to EV fast charging stations, starting with the city of Nanjing. To date, as there is rapidly-evolving technology development in the areas of EV charging and energy management and storage solutions, we are dependent on the certification of new technologies and apparatus for commercial use such that we ensure the most up to date technologies and charging experience are deployed.

**G: Other Financial Services / ABS**

In August of 2018, Ideanomics announced an agreement with NTC to provide ABS refinancing for buses in several China cities, including Tianjin. Subsequently, Ideanomics announced agreements in January of 2019 with financial institutions to provide financing and other services to support the ABS under the NTC agreement.

The debt rating of Tianjin at municipal level, along with delayed deliveries from manufacturers, has proved challenging for underwriting and issuance of ABS. In June of 2019, Ideanomics signed an agreement with EV bus and battery manufacturer Yinlong covering both China and Ex-China activities. As Yinlong had already delivered 5.1Billion RMB of manufacturer financed EV buses in Tianjin, outside of the Ideanomics agreement, we began discussions in late Q3 / early Q4 with Yinlong to reorganize the registration and recording of those delivered assets such that they can be compliant with ABS requirements. That activity is underway, albeit it was disrupted and delayed by the Coronavirus activities in the region. Additionally, MEG plans to work closely with Yinlong in 2020 to help support the delivery of additional city bus orders in order to facilitate the ABS refinancing accordingly.

In June of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with GCL, to include GCL contributing guaranteed sales orders of 500,000 logistical vehicle orders over the next three years. These orders will require financing under the lease financing activities covered in section A, as the original barter-plus-subsidy deal put in place is not being accepted by manufacturers. Several of the small to mid-size orders from the GCL order flow are currently in the pipeline to help develop and streamline the deal expediting process of our lease financing activities.

NEW YORK, March 10, 2020 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ --¬†[Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2745651-1&amp;h=202550487&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics),¬†(NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced a detailed update to its Mobile Energy Global (""MEG"") activities, including the impact of the Coronavirus on its Q1 activities.

In general, Chinese companies returned to work at the start of March with most major commercial activities slowly getting back to normal. MEG's partners have been impacted to varying degrees and recent conversations have shown there is a resolute effort being made to recover quickly from the effects of the outbreak. Currently, there¬†are no details available for any government stimulus programs to help the Chinese economy recover from the shutdown, so we are unable to determine what participation opportunities, if any, may be available to Ideanomics and MEG.

**A: Financing / Funding for Fleet Purchasing**

In September 2018, Ideanomics announced its agreement with First Auto Loan, regarding lease financing and ABS products with a target of raising $6 Billion to fund the lease financing of ride-share vehicles and other types of app-requested taxis. This agreement is currently in progress and will benefit from the capital sourcing referenced below.

In November and December of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced the creation of multiple funds in association with Dasheng Licheng Lease Financing, with Ideanomics bringing in several high-profile insurance companies to provide large-scale funds to support EV lease financing programs. The final province-level registrations were underway when the outbreak occurred and are now back underway. The impact on bringing these funds to market will now extend into Q2 but should otherwise remain unaffected.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an agreement with China's Yunnan province which included lease financing for the heavy truck segment, with backing by AAA-rated province-specific entities in conjunction with MEG's lease financing programs. The deal also provided for investment into charging station infrastructure, as well as investment into Treeletrik via Yunnan's role as the ASEAN region's belt and road sponsor. The shutdown impacted the timing on this, particularly as it pertained to final registration and approvals at local government, but is expected to be reinstated in the near term.

**B: EV and EV Battery Manufacturing Alliance**

Over the course of the past 18 months or so, Ideanomics, and subsequently MEG, has partnered with leading EV and EV Battery manufacturers, including JAC, Geely, Beijing Foton, CATL, and Yinlong, among others. These partnerships are an important part of the overall offering and assist MEG in offering competitive procurement and order fulfillment. Having best-in-class partners ensures we can meet the needs of fleet operators in terms of vehicle specifications, quality, reliability, and cost and continue to attract large-scale order interest.

As part of the commencement of activities in Qingdao, we will be showcasing many of these partners at our EV sales hub and anticipate additional manufacturing partners participating based on their value to the overall offering.

We had begun to implement a joint marketing strategy with select partners, including our participation with CATL in the now postponed EV Mining event in Stockholm, Sweden on March 18-20. It has been tentatively rescheduled until November of this year, due to Coronavirus concerns.

**C. Joint Ventures and Other Strategic and Umbrella Agreements**

Ideanomics and MEG has announced several agreements as either joint ventures, strategic partnerships, or umbrella agreements, which form part of MEG's business development and revenue pipeline development activities. These include deals with the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for MEG involvement in supporting the transition to EV mining, which we anticipate will be a significant revenue division for our organization; Zhitong 3000, where we intend to offer their fleet customers' MEG services; activities securing relationships with tourism associations to develop EV tour bus revenues; and more. Each of these is progressing in the normal course of business in the context of earlier sections of this update and, in particular, section A as it pertains to lease financing services.

**D: Sales Agreements for Execution**

In August of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with iUnicorn, to procure and finance 90,000 taxis for the city of Chengdu, in addition to other cities. In September of 2019, MEG announced the delivery of an additional 4,127 taxis, with confirmation of a further 11,000 to be delivered by the end of 2019. These are subject to the return of local government, to process the final rebate and registration approvals. We anticipate this occurring when the spring temperatures reduce the impact of the outbreak and cities return to normal levels of commerce and the resulting demand for public transportation is restored to pre-outbreak levels.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an order from Yunnan province for 35,000 taxis, and an additional order for 2,300 taxis from the city of Guillin, in Guanxi province. Both of these orders are delayed due to the closure of non-essential local government services, which we anticipate returning to normal in a similar manner to the iUnicorn JV.

In addition to the sales agreements mentioned above, the MEG team has developed a diverse pipeline of sales orders, with interest and activities in all four of its EV revenue divisions of Heavy Trucks, Buses and Coaches, Logistical Vehicles, and Taxis. In lieu of the lease financing funds availability, MEG has been pursuing bespoke financing for each order, respectively. Furthermore, the recently announced Qingdao sales center activities will help further augment sales going forward.

**E. Global EV Sales Expansion**

In March of 2019, Ideanomics announced the acquisition of 51% of Malaysia-based EV manufacturer and distributor, Treeletrik. Since the acquisition, Treeletrik has hired an experienced CEO from the automotive industry, increased its sales and after sales operations, upgraded the land secured under the acquisition from leasehold to title holder, secured orders elsewhere in the ASEAN region, and is in negotiations to bring in a number of Chinese EV manufacturing and EV battery partners to help round out its KD and assembly activities such that it can scale its supply operations to ensure order fulfilment.

Outside of Asia, MEG has received some preliminary order inquiries in the Middle East and plans to broadly expand its global footprint once all of its China-based activities are under way.

**F: Energy Sales**

MEG's core strategy is to acquire fleet customers, through offering innovative and cost-efficient transition to EV, such that we transition the consumption of energy from Gasoline and Diesel onto cleaner Electricity. MEG has signed numerous joint venture and strategic partnership agreements to help develop its relationships in this regard and plans to sell both pre-paid electricity at a discount to fleet operators, as well as participate in the lucrative EV charging market. Each of these is valid and in process for normal course of business, with the major highlights detailed below.

In July of 2019, Ideanomics announced agreements with Three Gorges, to include Tianda Energy and Ding Fang, and Palcan Energy to finance and develop EV fast charging networks. MEG has continued to explore these and other EV fast charging technologies, including those from our EV battery partners, as detailed in the PetroChina update below.

In September 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with PetroChina, to begin a project to repurpose gas stations to EV fast charging stations, starting with the city of Nanjing. To date, as there is rapidly-evolving technology development in the areas of EV charging and energy management and storage solutions, we are dependent on the certification of new technologies and apparatus for commercial use such that we ensure the most up to date technologies and charging experience are deployed.

**G: Other Financial Services / ABS**

In August of 2018, Ideanomics announced an agreement with NTC to provide ABS refinancing for buses in several China cities, including Tianjin. Subsequently, Ideanomics announced agreements in January of 2019 with financial institutions to provide financing and other services to support the ABS under the NTC agreement.

The debt rating of Tianjin at municipal level, along with delayed deliveries from manufacturers, has proved challenging for underwriting and issuance of ABS. In June of 2019, Ideanomics signed an agreement with EV bus and battery manufacturer Yinlong covering both China and Ex-China activities. As Yinlong had already delivered 5.1Billion RMB of manufacturer financed EV buses in Tianjin, outside of the Ideanomics agreement, we began discussions in late Q3 / early Q4 with Yinlong to reorganize the registration and recording of those delivered assets such that they can be compliant with ABS requirements. That activity is underway, albeit it was disrupted and delayed by the Coronavirus activities in the region. Additionally, MEG plans to work closely with Yinlong in 2020 to help support the delivery of additional city bus orders in order to facilitate the ABS refinancing accordingly.

In June of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with GCL, to include GCL contributing guaranteed sales orders of 500,000 logistical vehicle orders over the next three years. These orders will require financing under the lease financing activities covered in section A, as the original barter-plus-subsidy deal put in place is not being accepted by manufacturers. Several of the small to mid-size orders from the GCL order flow are currently in the pipeline to help develop and streamline the deal expediting process of our lease financing activities.

RamzFanz	1583785834	"OGEN dropped to .60 today with the market. It‚Äôs irrationally over-sold, IMHO.

Massive insider buys recently.

They have three investor conferences in March. The next one is next Sunday, March 15th. This should run into Friday closing. Results being released at that conference is legitimately possible within the timeline. The study concluded weeks ago.

Phase 2 results could drop any day but are officially expected early April.

AG013, with good results, will almost certainly lead to licensing deals or a buyout. It‚Äôs an FDA fast-racked drug and EU Orphan drug with a very conservatively estimated $750M annual sales market. Based on previous results, it‚Äôs expected to be at least 70% effective for Oral Muctosis, a painful symptom in 70% of chemo and radiation patients.

It‚Äôs both a prevention and treatment. There is no other drug like it. It uses genetically altered bacteria to deliver a treatment the bacteria itself produces directly to the wound through a mouth rinse.

I added more today to bring my total to 16,000 shares.

This stock, with good results, is easily valued at $3+ a share.

Innovation Pharmaceuticals Brilacidin Received by U.S. Regional Biocontainment Laboratory; Testing Against Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 
WAKEFIELD, MA ‚Äì March 9, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) Innovation Pharmaceuticals (OTCQB:IPIX) (‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, announces today the Company has been notified by one of the 12 Regional Biocontainment Labs (RBLs) in the United States that it received shipment of Brilacidin, the Company‚Äôs defensin mimetic drug candidate, for testing against SARS-CoV-2, the specific coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Brilacidin is immediately being placed into queue and the Company anticipates confirmation of the testing schedule as well as procedures for the studies later this week.
 
Brilacidin and COVID-19
The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak poses a significant life-threatening and economic risk throughout the world. Over 109,500 cases have been diagnosed in at least 95 countries, resulting in 3,800 reported deaths, including 479 cases and 21 fatalities in the U.S. There are no effective approved therapies to treat COVID-19. Brilacidin is one of the few drugs targeting COVID-19 that has been tested in human trials for other clinical indications, providing an established safety and efficacy profile, thereby potentially enabling it to rapidly help address the emerging worldwide coronavirus crisis, developed both as an intravenous medicine and as a vaccine. There is no assurance made or implied that testing Brilacidin for antiviral activity against any coronavirus will be successful.

AIM ImmunoTech‚Äôs Drug Ampligen to Be Tested by Japan‚Äôs National Institute of Infectious Diseases as a Potential Treatment for the New SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Responsible for the New Human Infectious Disease COVID-19
Monday, March 9, 2020 6:30 AM
OCALA, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 9, 2020 / AIM ImmunoTech (NYSE American:AIM), an immuno-pharma company focused on the research and development of therapeutics to treat immune disorders, viral diseases and multiple types of cancers, today announced that the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan will begin testing AIM's drug Ampligen as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the new coronavirus infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The experimental program will be conducted at both the NIID and the University of Tokyo.

The testing and research are being conducted by Hideki Hasegawa, MD, PhD, Director of the NIID's Influenza Virus Research Center, and Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Tokyo and Takeshi Ichinohe, PhD, Department of Pathology at the NIID, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science.

""As we have been saying all along, this emerging pandemic is caused by a virus that has nearly identical regulatory RNA sequences to the original SARS coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-1, in respect to pathogenesis. This means that the prior studies of Ampligen in SARS-CoV-1 animal experimentation may predict similar protective effects against the new virus. The WHO has recently renamed this emerging, highly pathogenic virus as SARS-CoV-2,"" said AIM CEO Thomas K. Equels. ""Ampligen had excellent antiviral activity against the earlier SARS coronavirus in U.S. National Institutes of Health-contracted animal experiments. In those studies of SARS-infected mice, Ampligen stands out as the only drug tested that conferred a significant survival effect: 100% of the Ampligen-treated mice survived, while none of the untreated mice survived. Because SARS-CoV-2 shares many critical similarities with SARS-CoV-1, Ampligen may have an important role to play in developing a protective early-onset therapy for this new highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, where currently there is no known effective therapy. We are proud to work with Japan's universally esteemed NIID in the battle to curb this emerging potential pandemic.""

Ampligen has established itself as a broad-spectrum antiviral with an extremely well-developed safety profile (See: ""Ampligen as an Antiviral,"" safety slides 7-15, at https://aimimmuno.com/events-presentations/).

AIM will provide stockholders and the market with updates on results as they are available."	Here are my 2 Coronavirus picks.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fftoc2/here_are_my_2_coronavirus_picks/

Antisocial916	1583712914	How does after hours trading work? Friday at closing I was interested in a stock that was around .70.  I checked it now and it's over $2. So does that mean Monday morning it will open at $2 ( assuming things stay the same ) Is it generally a bad idea to buy in right when the market opens? In the past I've bought after hours but both times the order cancelled at the end of the day. Any advice would be appreciated. I may have held on a little too long to Ibio tho I did get in early at .71, mistakenly jumped into ino at $15.50  and didn't grab spec early enough. Thanks in advance.

mikehall1	1583703762	"Big week coming up for traders in this market - many opportunities to make great trades that don't come around very often. I'll be discussing the top plays of the day every day LIVE on our Youtube channel @ 9AM eastern.

**SPEX** nice move Friday on serious volume, gapping after hours as well. I'll be watching this one for a specific play at the open called the opening washout long. We'll need to see a gap up Monday morning on volume to confirm continued interest into this week from buyers. Key levels ahead are $2.65/$3.00 as resistance - as long as we don't see any large red candles over 5m during pre / or an offering this play should be in tact.

**HTBX** Volume faded Friday after the big move on Thursday -- so Monday will be a very telling day for the future of this name. We'll need to see a reclaim over $0.90 w/ volume to break the $1.25 level. Key support level at $0.70 needs to hold on any dips Monday/Tuesday for continuation. I wouldn't be shocked to see another PR Monday/Tuesday to get it back above $1.00.

**BCRX** very bullish chart and overall trade thesis here - over $4.25 has a gap to fill towards the $7 area w/ a few forward looking events coming this month. Major watch if we continue to see higher lows above the $3.75 level.

**TOCA** clear daily breakout into the gap here worth watch Monday morning - either we see a consolidation day or continuation over highs. Key levels to watch $2.55/$2.88 on dips, see if they hold trend above that level and can retest highs over $3.00.

**SPY** volatility showing up like crazy lately, which gives us an opportunity to make money. Need to see a gap up tomorrow and a hold &gt; $293/$294 on dips w/ higher lows to see a rebound.

**VSTM** beautiful daily chart here coiled up for a nice breakout continuation towards $4 area -- $3.00/$3.10 key supports."	üî•Watchlist for 3/9-3/13üî•	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ffjpnk/watchlist_for_39313/

&gt;**Aurora Cannabis**¬†(¬†[TSE:ACB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACB/)) has had a rough start to 2020, with analyst after analyst taking hits at the struggling stock. A variety of factors are to blame for this, both within and outside the companies control, however what is for certain is the risks now associated with the company due to its $1.00 price range. Because of this, the company is at high risk of being taking off the national stock exchanges to be listed on the over the counter markets as a penny stock. If this happens, the outlook is even more uncertain due to the fact that stocks that are down-listed will have a harder time up-listing within a year of its down-listing.

uwishucouldunswallow	1583641777	"Listen up. Yes, we might be headed into a real bear market, but ideally, you don't just want to be shorting without any reasoning behind it. My rule is that I buy puts on companies that are headed to zero anyways, like $ACB (sorry if this triggers you potheads) or $SEAS (I only want to be in the splash zone with Jerome Powell) or $PLAY. One such company that I've looked into, is a shitty topgolf competitor called Drive Shack ($DS).

Now, $DS already sucks big time. I know, because I've been to a Drive Shack location, and it was a surreally shitty experience. We waited forever, the food took forever (even though no one was there) and it sucked and the fucking golf didn't even work and they had to reset it it while we were playing. TopGolf was a lot of fun, $DS was absolutely shitty. I've been calling $DS and TopGolf (privately held, unfortunately) on the weekends, and the wait time at their locations is nonexistent compared to TopGolf.

To compound this, revenue has been going down, earnings are negative, and they're still going down, and they just closed their biggest revenue maker, their location in Orlando. Their turnaround strategy? Opening a bunch of fucking put put golf courses, which they project bringing in $3m per year. However, all the comparable courses only bring in $1m or less per year. Their business strategy is fucked and their management is incompetent. Everybody who worked there when I visited looked like they hated their job and I saw some of the workers talking shit about management.

The $2.50 puts were super OTM when I bought them, but they've already made me a bunch of tendies and now they're solidly ITM. And the best part? This doesn't even take into account the beer virus. The Coronavirus will fuck $DS so hard and put them out of business by the end of the year. No boomers are going to a shitty TopGolf competitor when the Coronavirus is spreading.

dp79	1583613772	"Why I think Monday will be a good day:

1.	There‚Äôs a short sale restriction (SSR) Monday

2.	It‚Äôs a popular stock so there will be good volume with much less shorts occurring 

3.	The last time there was an SSR activated (3/4), the stock recovered FULLY from a really terrible day the day before

4.	The CEO is business/stock savvy. He put out a PR on 3/4 in conjunction with the SSR, which helped the stock price to recover. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he puts out a PR on Monday as well 

5.    The CEO‚Äôs total compensation is closely dependent on the stock. I think he‚Äôs motivated to keep the price at or above $1 for many reasons, and I believe he will be active with news this week and to keep the momentum going. 

6.	News outlets might catch onto the fact that what HTBX is working on for coronavirus actually prevents AND treats. It‚Äôs basically a vaccine (prevention) and drug (treatment) in one. This is HIGHLY UNIQUE!

7.	I think the other vaccine stocks are trading at their current peaks (INO, MRNA, NVAX) and are better candidates for shorting on Monday. I think the shorts will play over there especially with the SSR in place for HTBX. 

8.	There‚Äôs potential for a really nice short squeeze with all of the factors at play

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Why I think it will be good short term for the stock‚Äî there‚Äôs a lot of good news to report:

1.	Company could announce officially getting gov‚Äôt funding for the coronavirus vaccine

2.	The first patient enrolled in HS-110 ComPACT Phase 1 will be given the last dose on Monday (3/9). Phase 1 focused on safety so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see an update 

3.	PTX-35 is awaiting FDA approval and the start of Phase 1. The company stated it expected the FDA to approve in Q2

4.	Their biggest drug is HS-110 ImPACT which is in Phase 2 in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb. Results so far have been extremely positive, and it‚Äôs possible Bristol Myers could be a buyout candidate before Phase 2 completes since the results have been so good. 

This is based off my own research, and I thought I‚Äôd share. I highly recommend you do your own research and not make any crazy decisions based off of comments you see in forums (including mine)."

Jimmy_bags	1584820885	"Okay, no one cares to divulge any trading strategy that makes them money in fear someone will mess it up for them.  Theoretically me telling people this would benefit everyone including companies that are being traded.  Firstly find a honey hole in the market stock, maybe a few.  Use a screener such as finviz.  Find the below--

- priced $1 or less
- avg. volume between 200k and 400k 
- volatility medium to high
-market cap under 10 mil 
(reason is if market cap is too high chances are they have way too many outstanding shares and the market swings normally dont work in your favor) 

Get the list of stocks that meet this criteria.. now heres the important part. look at the history and see how much it normally drops and gains in the last 2 months or so.   Now WATCH add these stocks to your robinhood list and just watch them.  

When you think you know its lowest, take all the money your willing to invest in the stock now take about 1/6th of that and use that to purchase shares.  Now wait... of course itll drop bc that's your luck, now take another 1/6th and lower your average.. of course itll drop bc that's your luck, now take another 1/6th and buy more to lower your average.  

-buy like this through out  the day, with any luck you'll still have 1/6 or even 2/6 of y ok or cash left over.  

-next day at open chances are itll be up and you lowering your average paid off and you can sell.

- if next day drops more buy more and use your best judgment.  You'll profit sooner than later.  

ONLY RULE IS DO NOT CATCH A FALLING KNIFE! Some sectors have a reputation of falling more and more until you lose it all and it seems like never to get to the price you bought it for.  

The key is to watch, watch, watch. Theoretically this strategy works for ALL stock but not everyone has that kind of money to throw at a stock. So Pennies is what I play with.  So far this has never failed me. Key is to make sure you still have cash to average down and WATCH.  

I know there may be a few ppl reading saying ""yeah then you lose it all trying to catch a falling knife""  no, you didnt understand the WATCH portion of the DD. Dont just jump in blind."

masterumm	1584814920	"Hi guys,

I‚Äôve just been trading for about a week now. Made some wins but also made some losses along the way but I was wondering if anyone can advise on some questions I have:

1. I‚Äôm on IBKR (I know, it‚Äôs not the best but I live outside the states and this seems to be a good alternative) currently and so far the experience has been fairly positive. However, I realised there are certain things I cannot buy/sell such as JNUG which prompts the message ‚ÄúContract is not available for trading‚Äù - is there a reason behind this?
2. Still trying to understand how stop-sell orders work. From what I know, it automatically sells your order the moment it reaches the stop price. I‚Äôd tried it once when the average price I bought in was $1.1 and I made a stop-sell order of $1. It did hit $1 and lingered for quite a while but it just didn‚Äôt go through. Did I do something wrong? I notice in IBKR that there is a Attached Order Details field as well which I can select a Stop Loss - what is the difference?
3. I bought 1k shares averaging at 2.3225 of a certain stock awhile back and then bought another 500 at 1.58 average. This would mean my average price is 2.08 for 1.5k shares. I had sold that 500 at 1.6 which I would assume my average price would be back up to about 2.3-ish. However, I still see the average price at 2.08. Is this a mistake? Reason I‚Äôm asking is because the app says I need to sell at an average price of 2.08 to break even in terms of unrealised P/L but I‚Äôve already sold off the 500 at only a mere profit of 0.02/share - so that average price to break even now shouldn‚Äôt still be at 2.08, isn‚Äôt it?
4. Last question - I‚Äôve heard people saying stocks are super volatile especially in times like this with the virus going on. When this subsides and the world is back to normal, will the stock market see the same volatility that can see shares rising over 100% which seems to be quite frequent these days?

OpGen is merging with the German company Curetis on 3/30. Curetis has CV-19 test kits approved in China and Europe.

OpGen is NOT just a CV stock however. If you look at my past posts, I've been in this company before CV was on the radar and making good money. Both companies have pending FDA clearances that could come anytime.

OpGen has Acuita: https://www.opgen.com/acuitas-tests/

Curetis has Unyvero: https://curetis.com/products/unyvero-a50-system/

Both of these products are game changers and will be generating revenue for the newco long after CV.

OpGen has earnings report on Tuesday 3/24, and will be providing a general business update. This could include merger news and possibly FDA update.

What's my experience? 

* I live in their corporate city and have been a customer since they opened.
* I worked for them as a contract driver for three months, and after one month was a lead training driver for new hires.
* Several close friends who worked in the corporate office.
* And without disclosing too much, my primary job included a direct relationship with them for key financial transactions related to operations during their start up. Conditions of me working for them temporary included not being directly involved for servicing their account as a conflict of interest.

Waitr was founded, great company. Revolutionary, etc. Their value came in their system and app development - which is second to none. They were a home town company that was able to scale because of key investors, and essentially buying out other startups before they could get their wheels turning.

* [Drew Brees because he is a key owner in Walk-Ons, which was one of the top restaurants for Waitr.

After going public, they disclosed a major overhaul of their fee/commission structure with restaurants which dramatically altered their forecasted financials. [This has lead to the former CEO stepping down, and the company being investigated and facing class action for securities fraud.](https://reveallafayette.com/2019/10/a-class-action-lawsuit-creates-an-uncertain-future-for-waitr/)

Changing the commission structure and platform terms pissed off all restaurants. First progressive fees based on order volume, second was price control. The only ones that were viable and stayed on the app were the ones with the most volume (BWW, Walkons, a few local chains with high orders). Most likely restaurants in quarantine focus cities will hop back on for now, but I would assume only short term.

Drivers originally were 1099 contract (like I was) then shifted to be FTEs with benefits. Hourly drivers were paid $5 per hour plus gratuities, against minimum wage. Do you think they could pay FTEs and benefits for someone bringing in $10-$20 per hour of revenue (deliver fees, and restaurant commission)? As a lead driver I could tell you that my estimate is less than 25% of drivers were efficient and profitable for the company. People were fired constantly for clocking in to be paid  minimum wage and only accepting orders when they were called out just to stay active.

[The company has now switched back to full contract fleet in order to cut benefit and ancillary FTE costs. Contract drivers are paid $2.50 per delivery plus gratuities, against minimum wage.](https://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/business/article_e6044922-46d1-11ea-9a7c-f764e92356d6.html)

I can't speak to the class action in detail, however I think in order to turn the ship around they will have to change their business model to shift more cost to the customer VIA higher deliver fees instead of pissing off restaurants.

There may be a pump here and there because of food delivery spikes due to beer flu, but once I close these positions - I'm taking them off my watchlist for good.

HelenKellerIsAMyth	1584736904	"First off: https://twitter.com/roblowtv/status/1241047593280507907?s=21

Rob Low is our new best friend. He is a reporter in the Denver area. He said that the tests ‚Äúcould be coming‚Äù this upcoming week. AND he says that there have been talks between the Colorado governor and AYTU. The governor would not mention the kits to the public until he has them for sure, because imagine the backlash if he didn‚Äôt come through. 

Second: https://twitter.com/sencorygardner/status/1241091106336657408?s=21

Got recognition from a Colorado senator. Keep in mind, both these tweets have mentioned working with the FDA. Another key thing. 

People on StockTwits claim that they have confirmed the kits arrived in the US using some website but that‚Äôs above me so I cannot confirm nor deny it. 

Monday (or any day next week I suppose) is shaping up to be a potentially huge day:
-Possible announcement of kits finally in AYTU‚Äôs possession
-Possible announcement of a deal with the state of Colorado, and other orders lined up ideally. (See my post from yesterday about that property management company) 
-The closing of the latest offering 

Lots of us have waited long enough, sat through crazy drops and haven‚Äôt sold a share. Let‚Äôs hope all the stars align and Monday is a huge day, preferably with one huge premarket PR."	It is finally time for AYTU	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fm2chs/it_is_finally_time_for_aytu/

JohnnyLakefront	1584712882	"DECN just made an announcement. 

For those who don't know, DECN has been a hot topic around here. They announced recently that they will be getting in the covid testing have with an affordable at home testing kit.

A couple weeks ago they were at .02 cents, yesterday they made it up to nearly .25 cents.

They project 525 million units sold in the first 12 months @ about $7.00 per unit.

Today they announced that they've taken out a near 0% interest loan of $13 million to boost production of their covid-19 test.

These people are NOT fucking around. $13 million into the project to have this ball rolling.

Here's the announcement: 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decn-finance-2q-2020-roll-125500363.html


They also mention that people are contacting THEM for partnerships. People are clawing at their door to partner with DECN.

and on that note, here's a very interesting article from last year. This article is talking about their current diabetes test kits, but it's very interesting who they already have contacts with.

Someone is going to have to help them distribute these tests, and apparently they've already been shaking the right hands:

From my understanding, they only have about 100,000 test kits ready, and that is not enough for a whole country, let alone multiple. With the new money, they may be able to fund these test kits to make more money, making the stock go up.

mr_rivrra	1584647173	AYTU is being treated as the next IBIO stock, and I'm not really sure if that's a good thing. There's plenty of good news surrounding the stock and the profit it may bring with it's COVID-19 Testing kits, however I'm not really quite sure if it's exactly what everybody seems to believe. I don't really know if this is another case in which the stock price will merely double with the FDA announcement. Sure, it'll jump, but the company itself still has to help test an entire country. Even if this new testing kit comes to light, what makes it say that it'll be successful in its goals? This isn't me being a dick and saying you're all wrong, I genuinely am curious. All I'm saying is there was a shit ton of people saying IBIO was a money making stock and it literally lasted for a couple of days(correct me if I'm wrong). My thoughts are to wait for the FDA to say something, and immediately sell before it gets low again due to hype dying. Then maybe pick it up again at a lower price if I see the news on it are beneficial.

bobbyusn	1584612313	"VANCOUVER, Washington, March 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytoDyn Inc. (OTC.QB: CYDY), (‚ÄúCytoDyn‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany""), a late-stage biotechnology company developing leronlimab (PRO 140), a CCR5 antagonist with the potential for multiple therapeutic indications, announced today that two coronavirus patients were treated with the Company‚Äôs investigational new drug, leronlimab. The treatment was administered at a leading medical center in the New York City area under an emergency Investigational New Drug (IND) recently granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Leronlimab is intended to serve as a therapy for patients who experience respiratory illness as a result of contracting the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The treatment of these patients was not under the Company‚Äôs proposed randomized controlled Phase 2 clinical trial protocol recently submitted to the FDA.   


Bruce Patterson M.D., CEO of IncellDX and advisor to CytoDyn, added, ‚ÄúLeronlimab binds to the CCR5 receptor inhibiting the migration of macrophages and the release on inflammatory cytokines including TNF and IL-6. This release of cytokines is what is commonly referred to as the 'cytokine storm' and is believed to cause profound damage in the lungs in some patients. In addition, leronlimab can block Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which can inhibit the innate immune response against pathogens, into areas of inflammation. These combined mechanisms of action may reduce the morbidity and mortality in moderate to severe cases of COVID-19, preventing the acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with this highly destructive and potentially fatal disease.‚Äù   


Nader Pourhassan, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of CytoDyn said, ‚ÄúWe are very pleased that we have a potential treatment **option** for patients affected by COVID-19 infection. To be very clear, leronlimab does not kill the novel coronavirus. It acts as a CCR5 antagonist by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines, which prevents cytokine storm and thus could be useful in treatment of COVID-19. Leronlimab is administered as a once-a-week injection. It has a strong safety profile demonstrated in nine clinical trials with over 800 people and is available for urgent treatment. If results are promising, we have leronlimab available for immediate use and the ability to scale production. We are open and willing to work with government agencies and pharmaceutical partnerships to assist in serving those in dire need of a treatment option for this devastating disease. We appreciate the FDA‚Äôs prompt response and are working in full support of the treating medical team.‚Äù   


About Coronavirus Disease 2019   
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. The origin of COVID-19 is uncertain and it is unclear how easily the virus spreads. COVID-19 is thought to be transmitted person to person through respiratory droplets, commonly resulting from coughing, sneezing and close personal contact. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals. For confirmed COVID-19 infections, symptoms have included fever, cough and shortness of breath. It is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure, and that symptoms in patients have ranged from non-existent to severe and fatal. At this time, there are very limited treatment options for COVID-19.   


About Leronlimab (PRO 140)   
The FDA has granted a ‚ÄúFast Track‚Äù designation to CytoDyn for two potential indications of leronlimab for deadly diseases. The first as a combination therapy with HAART for HIV-infected patients, and the second is for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Leronlimab is an investigational humanized IgG4 mAb that blocks CCR5, a cellular receptor that is important in HIV infection, tumor metastases, and other diseases including NASH. Leronlimab has successfully completed nine clinical trials in over 800 people, including meeting its primary endpoints in a pivotal Phase 3 trial (leronlimab in combination with standard antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected treatment-experienced patients).   


In the setting of HIV/AIDS, leronlimab is a viral-entry inhibitor; it masks CCR5, thus protecting healthy T cells from viral infection by blocking the predominant HIV (R5) subtype from entering those cells. Leronlimab has been the subject of nine clinical trials, each of which demonstrated that leronlimab can significantly reduce or control HIV viral load in humans. The leronlimab antibody appears to be a powerful antiviral agent leading to potentially fewer side effects and less frequent dosing requirements compared with daily drug therapies currently in use.   


In the setting of cancer, research has shown that CCR5 plays an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Increased CCR5 expression is an indicator of disease status in several cancers. Published studies have shown that blocking CCR5 can reduce tumor metastases in laboratory and animal models of aggressive breast and prostate cancer. Leronlimab reduced human breast cancer metastasis by more than 98% in a murine xenograft model. CytoDyn is, therefore, conducting a Phase 1b/2 human clinical trial in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and was granted Fast Track designation in May 2019. Additional research is being conducted with leronlimab in the setting of cancer and NASH with plans to conduct additional clinical studies when appropriate.   


The CCR5 receptor appears to play a central role in modulating immune cell trafficking to sites of inflammation and may be important in the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and other inflammatory conditions. Clinical studies by others further support the concept that blocking CCR5 using a chemical inhibitor can reduce the clinical impact of acute GvHD without significantly affecting the engraftment of transplanted bone marrow stem cells. CytoDyn is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical study with leronlimab to further support the concept that the CCR5 receptor on engrafted cells is critical for the development of acute GvHD and that blocking this receptor from recognizing certain immune signaling molecules is a viable approach to mitigating acute GvHD. The FDA has granted ‚Äúorphan drug‚Äù designation to leronlimab for the prevention of GvHD."	CytoDyn Inc.

If you're going to gamble, pick your spots. There have been two recent studies about this subreddit. Both stated that **99.32% of stocks on /r/pennystocks fail after 6 months.**

A total collapse.

Although you can still profit. If you're a good trader, you can take advantage of this market. Perhaps some markets have good discounts right now. It's up to you to decide.

Let's say you make the best investment decision of your life and grow $1 to $1000 overnight from one stock.  You sell, and re-enter at $900 to get some additional value and/or solidify $100 profit.

Since every sale is a taxable event, ""sell and buy the dip"" would only work if the dip saves you more than the taxes cost, right?

Once the oil price war is over it will have a small recovery short term, but in a couple years i believe this'll be back to it's regular value.  Bought in at .95 myself.

itsalwaysdeniz	1584481615	"Hello guys. This will possibly be the millionth post that starts with the sentence ""I am new to trading""

I have been following this sub a while and have got into some interesting stocks through it. Like CPE, CHK, SWN which have been performing quite well, and I have been short selling on the go and increasing the amount I have on these papers. Then I have some shares in other oil/energy and biotech companies, which havent been performing very well, but not too bad either. My biotech papers are rather big companies like GILD, so I can see it as a long term investment too. I so idealistically, and oh well greedily too went in TSLA as well and oh my oh my. But it's all fine.

The uncertainty I am having now is.. where am I headed with the penny stocks? I will surely keep at least some a good while as their future looks if anything highly promising. But I still have a feeling that I will simply not know when to jump off the train. 

So that's why I had the urge to post this question here, to the more experienced, and who is maybe not a full-on day trader as I am not. How do you generally know when to jump off? Also, what sort of a balance do you have between your stocks? Do you only have penny stocks? Or do you generally use your gainings from these to get these so called blue chip stocks? 

I hope these aren't all non-sense questions, and I know there absolutely is no definite answer. But I am very interested and grateful to know more experienced investors' approach on these matters.

The order is for 5,000 full size electric buses, for use in various locations. The vehicles have an average cost of 800,000 Renminbi (approx. $115,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling 4Billion Renminbi, or approximately $575 Million USD.

(‚ÄúSurge‚Äù) ([SURG](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=surg)), developer of the SurgePays‚Ñ¢ Marketplace Network for convenience stores, bodegas and community markets that provide products to the underbanked, today provided an update on Surge Logics, its wholly owned subsidiary.¬†  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Brian Cox, Chairman and CEO of Surge Holdings, commented, ‚ÄúWe are generating significant traction in our Surge Logics subsidiary.¬† This is best illustrated by the fact we achieved unaudited gross revenue of nearly $1 million in January 2020, close to a ten-fold increase versus the same period last year.¬† This puts us at an annualized revenue run-rate in excess of $10 million within this division alone.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Carter Matzinger, President of Surge Logics, added, ‚ÄúThe success of Surge Logics reflects our recent expansion initiatives including our investment in the development and launch of InTake Logistics, a proprietary intake management solution for law firms specializing in mass tort lawsuits. Our growth also reflects the synergies of our strategic equity stake in Centercom Global last year, which is having a sustained positive impact on our revenue.¬† This investment supports our ability to rapidly scale the business, as Centercom provides sales support, outbound client qualification, reporting, database programming, software development, and other various operational support services for Surge Logics. ‚Äù"	$SURG someone just slapped ask for $21,000 in one go.

I can also do some simple analysis like volume breakouts, gap ups, gap downs, gainers, seasonality (if certain stocks do well a certain month. This sounds dumb, but Chinese stocks for example almost always perform worse in December because of Lunar New Year), etc.

The main site would be free with a paid option to support the work and potentially hire someone to do the analysis.

RamzFanz	1584413445	"The DOW plummets almost 3,000 points, *the largest point drop in US history*, and OGEN closes up.

Nice!

Bio stocks are typically safer in outbreaks like this. I mean real ones, not the pump and dumps.

A few things I forgot to add to my initial [information](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/fi1giu/ogen_may_be_leaving_the_station_sunday/) and [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/fibhnv/ogen_changes_to_conferences_and_other_updates/) are that OGEN has NO debt and is fully funded through Q2 2021. Being that they are also finished with P2 and now compiling results, their expenses have almost certainly plummeted.

They are not at risk of having to shut down the study from COVID 19 concerns or infections, as other studies are, because the study is over. This is an important point because chemo/radiation patients are much more susceptible to very poor outcomes from COVID-19. An infection could have destroyed the study or made it impossible to continue. We're past that.

I almost sold half today knowing we were facing a massive drop with the futures market tanking, but I talked it over with my group, we reviewed our reasoning, and I held. I'm glad I did both. The position is solid, IMHO, and when I reviewed everything again, I couldn't find the flaw in the risk/reward of the position.

As I stated in my update, very large buys have been coming in. Another large buy came in today. We still have a belief that someone is angling for a buyout. Take that for what it's worth, which is just speculation, but it's based on the reasons previously given.

**If you can find a flaw, let us have it! We are a community!**

Don't get me wrong, I'm very apprehensive in this market being bullish on anything, but I can't find a reason to exit.

However, considering the market, I am lowering my expectations. IF this runs into results or with results, I may exit at $2+. I will definitely be using a trailing stop-loss and closely monitoring my charts.

""Keener operates a business through which he buys convertible notes, a form of short-term debt security, from penny stock issuers in need of cash. 

After holding the notes for approximately six months, Keener converts them into newly issued shares of stock at a deep discount to the prevailing market price, which he negotiates in advance of the purchase, and sells that stock into the market to lock in a profit.

Today, I introduce you to USO. I like this one tremendously. It had a slight dagger fall, and then downtrend to the point of a shocking outside bar &amp; a HODL position leading up to a curl/Cupping. 

[USO Chart](https://ibb.co/Ptdd2C4)

As you can clearly see, the bottom touched at 4.29. Individuals began testing it to see whether it would curl up or not, and it did with support levels 4.29 - 4.64 (very fair). The gap has a nice window at $10, which in my honest opinion huge window opportunity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: 

Small resistance window $5

Strong EPS

Severely oversold outside down trend line (see finiv also)

Strong bullish signal reversal [Bullish cup](https://ibb.co/jrSfxbb)

megamastergamer	1585250874	"At the start of the 2020 recession I saw MFA Mortgage Investments Inc. drop from its high of over $8.00 to a measly $0.50c, though yesterday (March 25th), an inevitable short squeeze happened and went parabolic, skyrocketing to $1.14 at close, a **356% increase**. Today in the pre-market, we had another surge in purchases which launched it to $2.25, almost **doubling** the price from yesterday's close.

I believe that tomorrow we will be primed for another short squeeze. Currently there is almost 7 million short interest. This stock's **AVERAGE** volume is merely \~4.5 million shares. The current short interest ratio (basically the max amount of time we expect shorts to cover their position by purchasing shares) is only 1.6 days. Along with that, the bull volume was insane at open today, and we have a lot of people taking their profits, which gives further fuel for the shorts. 

 [https://imgur.com/a/GPXjwMJ](https://imgur.com/a/GPXjwMJ) 

If you take a look at that graph, we currently have the next line of resistance at over $4.00 giving this a lot of upward potential. Along with that, once MFA broke out from downwards trend line was when we saw the parabolic gains. Right now, even though its falling a bit, we have it finding itself well above the upwards tend line we saw from its jumps.

Is anyone else hopping in on the MFA train?

When people post on here to do your own research, don't underestimate what they are saying. Don't follow the hype, by the time it's posted on this sub (most of the time) you find yourself buying at the peak for it to just dip and dip. 

Not putting this sub down because there are some positives:

Every once in a while you'll find something in time before it blows up. 
Sometimes people post good reliable news 
If your just getting into (like me) you can find a lot of advice and tips

THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS SUB:
When I do my research, and find a stock I love, this is a excellent sub to check if people are commenting about it. And nothing is better than not finding that stock I absolutely love on any post in this sub.

&gt;BOCA RATON, Florida, March 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --¬†StemSation International, Inc. (OTC PINK: STSN) ‚Äì a pioneer in the emerging category of dietary supplements called Stem Cell Nutrition, announces its home-based business model provides an opportunity for a primary or secondary source of income by utilizing web-based audio and video conferencing tools directly from home for marketing, communications and training purposes.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;According to financial experts, a global recession is starting to look more likely. An increase in unemployment causes people to look for other financial opportunities to support their families. People desire a solution that will give them more control over their future income. StemSation ¬†provides that solution as it relies on person-to-person sales by independent representatives, often working from home utilizing various web-based audio and video conferencing tools such as Go To Meeting, Ring Central, Vonage, Zoom and Skype that allow users to meet online, with or without video.¬†Stemsation's¬†direct selling¬†business offers you the ability to build, track and manage a¬†network¬†of independent business partners to assist with growth of sales revenue and income, utilizing a proprietary ""BackOffice"" software platform with your personalized website included. Because direct selling is a low-barrier opportunity (it doesn't require a large investment, minimum educational skills or prior business experience) anyone 18 years or older can start a direct selling home-based business.¬† Success is driven by the amount of time and effort put into sharing the unique benefits of the StemSation products with others. This makes StemSation an attractive opportunity for those who wish to overcome certain risks associated with a recession.¬† [https://www.stemsation.global/www/en/us/join/compensation/](https://www.stemsation.global/www/en/us/join/compensation/).¬†"	$STSN release big news this morning, offering income program for people now unemployed by COVID-19 crisis.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fpb8z2/stsn_release_big_news_this_morning_offering/

Nice-Location	1585174038	"I see A LOT of people on here freaking out about DECN dropping, unless there's some insider trading going on, (which would explain why it's dropping) which I highly doubt for a penny stock! 

Please stop freaking out people, who cares if it goes down to even 0.010 it wasn't even that high to begin with only peaking at .25. And when you compare it to other companies like AYTU, Ibio, etc etc who are around 1.30 per share, DECN still has plenty of room to grow. They will get FDA approval, it doesn't make sense why there diabetes test strips would get FDA approval but the Covid 19 test kits don't? Especially when you have investors investing 13 Million into this project. 

People are most likely selling because there's been no new news recently. Sorry that the CEO couldn't update you people on a day to day basis about his company. He's got bigger things to worry about. 

Now stop freaking out. 

Someone had to say it."	DECN	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fozbma/decn/
mtmtrader	1585173158	"As you most likely already know, the market has been a **bloodbath** over the past month or so due to fears of the [coronavirus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1) and its effect on the economy. Businesses have been closing and people have been ordered to stay at home to prevent the spread the disease. Inevitably, this will affect the economy and the stock market. Since all of this started happening, $SPY *(the ETF tracking the S&amp;P 500)* has fallen over 35% from its high of $339.08 in February 2020 to its recent low of $218.26 in March 2020.

A lot of people are under the impression that money can't be made in the market with such bearish conditions, which is **not** true. A bear market actually offers plenty of opportunities that are not always available in a bull market. In this post I'll be sharing some tips on how to handle the current market conditions, and how you can take advantage of it for both [day trading](https://masterthemarket.teachable.com/blog/197973/day-trading-vs-swing-trading) and long-term investing profits!

When it comes to day trading in a bear market, it's extra important to manage your risk. Bearish conditions typically bring along increased **volatility** in the market. That volatility is a great thing for day trading... but it can also be *terrible* thing. If you're not properly managing your risk, you should expect larger drawdowns and losses on your positions than you're typically used to while the market's volatility is high.

Obviously this is something most traders want to avoid, because managing risk properly is the name of the game. Because of that, I recommend trading with smaller-than-usual position sizes to offset the increased volatility. For example, if an average day trade position size for you is $10,000, you may want to try cutting that down to maybe $7,500, $5,000, or even less to avoid dealing with increased risk in a volatile market.

You may be worried that smaller positions will also take away from your profits, which should **not** be the case. You have to keep in mind that the increased volatility also can work in your favor when you're on the right side of a trade. If done properly, you should be both risking and profiting the same as you would on an average trade, even with a fraction of the position size.

Position size aside, it may be more difficult to find winning trades in a bear market if you only buy and sell. Instead, bear markets offer great [short-selling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vn-nKBn8fs&amp;t=2s) opportunities. Short-selling lets us profit from stocks going down, which can be a huge benefit in the weakness of a bear market.

**Here's a rundown on how short-selling works:**

**1.** You place an order to short-sell 100 shares of stock symbol ABC.

**2.** That order automatically requests to borrow 100 shares of ABC from your broker.

**3.** You sell the borrowed shares when you believe the price is going to go down.

**4.** Later you buy back the shares (*or cover*), which automatically returns them to your broker.

**5.** You either profit or lose the difference between where you bought and sold, multiplied by the number of shares traded.

You **always** want to buy low and sell high in the market! The only difference with short-selling is that you're selling high first and hopefully buying low after, which is easier in a bear market.

Even though I personally am mostly a short-term trader, I'm still excited about the long-term investment opportunities that this market selloff will offer too. Eventually, $SPY and the S&amp;P 500 will be back at their highs. This selloff is only making the future return to the highs more profitable for those that take advantage of it!

Now is not the time to afraid of the market and not the time to be afraid of losing... even though most people are. **Warren Buffett** even said *""Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.""* The fear in the market is higher than it's been in a long time, which means it's almost time to get greedy and buy, buy, and some more.

Although, it's important to not buy all at once. You can never expect to buy at the exact bottom, so it's better to **slowly** build a position over days, weeks or even months rather than buying your full position all at once. If you're planning on investing $10,000 into the market, you may want to buy $2,000 at a time as the price bottoms out.

Alternatively, you can also wait for the bottom of the selloff to be confirmed and for the price to start bouncing back up. By doing this you're guaranteeing that you are not buying the exact bottom, but you can also be confident that the selloff is over and the price is likely to start its climb back up.

Regardless, there is a lot more strategy to investing than most people think. You can't always find winners by buying into well-known companies. You should be doing some [fundamental analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLG8OPk0xAM) to find strong companies that will survive a recession and even out-perform the market. Looking for things like quarter over quarter and annual EPS growth, growing revenues, and high institutional ownership is a great start for a long-term investment.

On the technical side, it's best to see that the individual stock is performing better than $SPY and the S&amp;P 500. As I mentioned, $SPY is currently down about 35% from its highs at the time of this writing. A good investment is likely to also be dragged down by the market, but not a full 35%.

I hope this post calms some nerves about the current market selloff we're facing and gives you some ideas on how you can take advantage of it.

xElectricblaze	1585097503	"So I fucked up big time today. What was my biggest win yet became the worst day of trading for me.

So I have a relatively small account. a very small account actually. I only started with $100 2 weeks ago. throughout those 2 weeks I took small gains here in there of small plays and grew to $150. I was one of the people who say IMAC this morning and said oh 250% is defiantly the peak and checked it an hour later to only see it go to 500%. So I said fuck it and went all in on IMAC (which you should never do) at 2.44 per share. Seeing how my account was so small as long as I cut my losses quick (this is ironic me saying this later) It would of been fine. Im also at work while all of this is happening too. about 10 minutes later IMAC shoots up to 3.60 a share and stalls at that price for about 5 minutes. THIS is when I should of sold my shares because I was at 79% \^ or something and would of gotten an easy 77 dollar profit. But like a fool I got very greedy and wanted it to go higher, well it shot down to 3.00 a share and I panic sold. still not a bad loss I still profited 48 dollars which was awesome BUT 5 about an hour later the stock shot up to 4.15 and I was infuriated and FOMO kicked in and I bought it being greedy and wanting to get more out of it. long story short I kept panic selling and FOMO buying and had my worst day of all time trading so far. the reason I'm posting this is so no newbie does the same mistake I did. Im sure a lot of decent trader will see this and call me a retard and I'm totally ok with this because I am LOL its a lesson learned for me and hopefully I helped someone that will one day be in this situation and will remember what happened to my dumbass and just take their profits quick. Next time I wont let this happen to me lesson learned. I would post photos but it wont let me for some reason"	Biggest mistake you can make is FOMO and Greed	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/foh1m4/biggest_mistake_you_can_make_is_fomo_and_greed/
AcrobaticWord2	1585095659	"We all know these penny stocks are very risky. Right now you can get in after the hype and it seems like even after 300%, only a couple like Codx and BMRA went on to do an addition 4-600%.  Everything else is up 1-400% premarket and is usually done after one day.  The other option is picking a company that hasn‚Äôt run up yet and wait for news that may or may not come.

With the penny stocks you can get lucky and see 1-500% gains, but usually you will miss out unless you spread your money out thin.

With options, you can leverage and use the same money on a penny stock that can have the same payoff on blue chip stocks.  Only you aren‚Äôt at risk of being left holding after a pump and dump or getting involved with shady companies.  If you are right your bets can still pay off big.

somenamethatsclever	1585091121	Last time I posted in this group I was waiting for a 2.1 run up based on the news on covid tests in Miami, Detroit, and the president referring to opk.  This did not happen, the stock is 1.4. None of these news catalysts bumped the stock up to the regular    .20 increase. I am holding for the March 28th quarter release of profit from these testing kits. It should be the irefutable evidence needed to help solidify investors and stop the shorters.

Agile Therapeutics ($AGRX) is a pharmaceutical company and has one contraceptive product: Twirla. It was FDA approved in mid February 2020. Unfortunately, stock price has gone down due to stock dilutions and the CV outbreak, along with the fact that the FDA approval was baked into the stock price.

*"" okay since I heard someone mention BO i'll share my thoughts again. i know posters on other beaten down stocks scream &amp; hope for BO out of desperation but a few minutes of research and you notice - insider selling or product was PIII approved but still needs years and $ to submit NDA &amp; receive FDA approval. AGRX is diff and is a prime buy-out target! min of $8 in March or April is my guess.*

*1. Agile has expertise in developing products - not sales &amp; marketing*

*2. FDA approved product with big market share potential*

*3. Big pharma already have sales &amp; marketing teams, doctor connections, etc and can launch Twirla much sooner*

*4. Cheaper for big pharma to buy an FDA approved product instead of developing one that may take 5-10 years*

*5. CFO recently hired has sold last 3 prior companies*

*6. CEO also has a history of selling companies*

*7. Insider buying - quite a bit last 6 weeks*

*8. Big cash position for negotiation leverage. the timing of the cash raise suspect &amp; had a BO taste ""*

Analyst forecasts range from $6 - $15. It's currently hovering around $1.60. As long as you hold tight onto this stock, you should eventually make a profit if a BO happens :))

### Viemed increases Q1 revenue guidance to $23.7-million

2020-04-06 14:17 PT - News Release

Mr. Casey Hoyt reports

VIEMED HEALTHCARE RAISES FIRST QUARTER GUIDANCE AND PROVIDES UPDATE ON OPERATIONS AND RESPONSE TO COVID-19 VIRUS

Viemed Healthcare Inc. is increasing its previously issued net revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the company is providing an update on current operations and its response to the growing number of COVID-19 cases around the country.

 As previously disclosed, in response to the COVID-19 virus, the company began modifying its clinical protocols to limit unnecessary patient encounters to ensure the safety of its employees, as well as the safety of its patients. At this time, these measures do not appear to be negatively impacting the company's patient attrition rate. The company's current ability to assess potential patients in hospitals varies by hospital and city, but over all, the company's business of setting up new patients in the home is continuing.

Additionally, the company is working with various governmental agencies and health systems around the country to assist in the response to the COVID-19 virus. The company continues to be a resource to help transition patients with chronic respiratory failure, amongst other disease states, out of the hospital quicker to free up valuable hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The company is working to source equipment for third parties to be used in acute facilities to assist COVID-19 patients, and is preparing to mobilize certain of its therapists to educate other clinicians on ventilators, as well as to provide critical care in the facilities that need this assistance. The company is actively fulfilling equipment orders in the more severely COVID-19 impacted areas of Louisiana and New York, and continues to work with these states and others to help during this pandemic.

 As mentioned herein, the company has fulfilled some of the orders that have been received to date, and **anticipates fulfilling a larger amount during the second quarter**. The company continues to receive new equipment, and has been utilizing a portion of its existing equipment to assist with the immediate COVID-19 crisis while continuing to meet the needs of its patient base. As a result of these sales of new equipment, the company is revising its previously issued guidance and currently estimates that first quarter 2020 net revenues will be approximately $23.7-million to $23.9-million. Additionally, sales of previously used equipment will be recognized in gain on disposal of property and equipment in the company's financial statements and are currently estimated to be approximately $1.4-million to $1.5-million. Second quarter guidance based on this growing demand is expected to be provided during May in conjunction with the reporting of the company's first quarter results. The extent and duration of the effect of these additional sales on the company's operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak and actions taken by the government and private business to attempt to contain the COVID-19 virus, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape.

""I am very proud to see that the quick actions we have taken so far appear to be keeping our growing patient base comfortable in their homes and our employees safe, and there appears to be only positive impacts from our modifications of the treatment regimens,"" said Casey Hoyt, Viemed chief executive officer. **""We recognize that being one of the largest home-based ventilator companies in the country puts us in a unique position to help with the current pandemic.** We have long said our ventilator inventory and our network of respiratory therapists around the country are our two largest assets. Our team is working tirelessly on all potential solutions to help the government and health systems during this COVID-19 crisis.""

In November 2019, Vislink announced that it had been ‚Äú[Selected to Supply California Law Enforcement Agency with U.S.-Designed and Manufactured Drone Solution](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-selected-to-supply-california-law-enforcement-agency-with-u-s-designed-and-manufactured-drone-solution/)‚Äú.

&gt;*‚ÄúVislink was selected primarily based on having the only drone-based video transmission system proven interoperable with existing state and local law enforcement agency fixed and rotary-wing aircraft currently operating in the surrounding region. The inclusion of the MicroLite 3 in the solution was driven by its compact form factor and ability to securely transmit high-quality live video images.‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúWe continue to be a technology leader whose downlink solutions answer the needs of today‚Äôs law enforcement organizations,‚Äù said John Procacci, Vice President of Sales for Vislink Technologies. ‚ÄúProviding systems that support inter-agency coordination has always been one of our key strengths. Police and military agencies are increasing their use of drones in their operations. The MicroLite 3 is a natural fit for the growing numbers of drone-based military, law enforcement and commercial applications, and it opens the door for us to explore new opportunities in these areas.‚Äù*

&amp;#x200B;

On November 11, 2019, Vislink announced the renewal of three-year service contracts with **twelve UK Police Forces** for its¬†Airborne Data Link (ADL) infrastructure. The company further said that ‚Äúthere is also the potential for purchases of upgrades to installed ground infrastructure, as Vislink incorporates new technologies that increase capabilities for the police forces. This includes deployment of the Vislink TSM-2020 video aggregator. The TSM-2020 allows the onward transmission of airborne data to tactical ground forces deployed with smartphones and tablets over 4G and coming 5G networks.‚Äù

Tweeted just now: All t heir inspections have passed. Its all official now:  https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1246487885638971392?s=20

**Major announcement what would happend if they passed all inspections (Which they just did as of TODAY).**

This will yield FAR greater than our estimated $7,000 per liter.   LOI:  Production for 25 liters per day $7000+ Per Liter Revenues from this: $175,000 per day 

&amp;#x200B;

**Company confirms they will be uplisting and initiating a share buy back, just 2 days ago.** 

&gt;Yes, the plan is now uplisting, confirmation of share buy back, and dramatically increasing revenues month over month now that the inspections are complete and can initiate the LOI, which is open for roughly $150,000 per day of oil. 

&amp;#x200B;

**News came out that the oil they were producing came out as 10 points HIGHER in purity, which means it sells for MORE than they expected.**

I think within April we will be over $0.01 - And for the next quarter if the revenues continue, I see it hitting $0.05 with ease.

randomperson0284	1586019940	"I've been posting about this for a while. Apparently they are working to get a breakthrough status for their primary drug candidate to treat metastatic breast cancer, and the same drug has shown significant positive effect on covid 19 patients.


Charlie sheen took it to treat his HIV and also reportedly had great success with it.

The company had a scheduled interview on making money with charles Payne  on fox business but it was rescheduled to next week , april 8.

I sincerely think this is one of those rare chances to buy a penny biotech before it moons. 

TAKE A LOOK while you can still buy it low.

If this has even 1/3 of their applications approved by the FDA it will be a 5 or 10 bagger.

Can you even imagine if the drug gets breakthrough designation for cancer ontop of treating the virus AND being used globally? 

Theres NO treatments for Covid 19 right now and this is an actively IN USE treatment which great success thus far in around 10 patients with severe coronavirus effects.

GeneticJD	1585937638	"Hi.

Sorry if this isn't the right reddit for this question, but I am looking for someone that is familiar with the day trading limit on Robinhood.

I am not marked as a pattern day trader and I don't have a portfolio greater than $25,000, but I do typically use all 3 of my Day Trades within a 5 Day Trading Period. 

With that being said, Robinhood also has this box that shows Margin Health and Day Trade Buying Limits. Does anybody know why mine is negative? Also, is this box only directed at people that buy on margin. For what it's worth, I do **NOT** have margin trading turned on because I don't want to borrow money from Robinhood.

&amp;#x200B;

| Margin Health |GOOD |
|:-|:-|
|Volatility|Low|
|**Today‚Äôs Day Trade Limit**|\-$3,675.00|

I guess my question is - Does this box only affect margin day traders? Or could a non-pattern &amp; non-margin day trader also be subject to these day trade buying power limits. The Robinhood help section wasn't very helpful on this, it was somewhat unclear and didn't specify if it was directed at pattern day traders, margin traders, or everyone. 

I held shares of Inovio overnight and sold this morning, but my day trade buying power is still negative. If I attempt to buy new stocks, I don't receive any warnings about day trade limits or day trade calls.

TheBazaarTrades	1585813825	"Evening. Prior to Tuesday's performance, I apologize once again. I and others were hit with all-around fake bullish waves, fake breakouts, and dagger knife falls. We, as traders, will not make that mistake again. The lesson here, in a situation where the NASDAQ &amp; S&amp;P 500 chart are going sideways in the daily market, browse with caution. Considering the decent call outs I made, always observe assuring it's maintaining it's momentum and doesn't touch the max top and slamming hard down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did some overnight review, and I did find something with a powerful credible activity happening with my favorite chart thus far, [TRNX](https://ibb.co/9VYvMzX) Here are the pros and cons about this stock that are highly considerable a bullish explosion waiting to happen.

Pros: 

Outside bar breaking downtrend line resu inlting a NHOLD/HODL

Low float

Minimum gap target: 0.47, max target: 0.80+

EPS has been very well maintained &amp; balanced (great improvement in 2018 Q4)

Above all decent debt asset ratio, 24.05% ranked fairly well

PB: 0.09 (in trader's eyes, this is a good probability ratio to play with)

Considerable assets

Reviewed heavy ticket orders noticed at near after hours around 6pm est.

Oversold reaching a full bottom

1day chart appears to form a complete cup.

The daily chart shows NHOLD as mentioned above.

Cons: 

A lot of bag holders, likely to sell-off, however in conjunction to short sellers, the buyers are outweighing the shorters.   

The daily chart shows it's been dipping a lot, however, I recommend caution &amp; buy only if it matches the criteria, in my opinion, breaking more than 0.17 to 0.18 + 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, for those asking if I am holding in anything else, I am still currently holding XSPA. As the news has been recently reporting, the US, unfortunately, are using outside tents as a form of hospital care. I sincerely hope XSPA (despite originally it was a spa source) will be a contribution and an asset aiding people somehow."

With a cash account I initially split my buying power fairly evenly every other day or so but over time it leaned where one day had around two to sometimes three times the power than the other day. I then found that my better green days were mostly when I had less buying power overall. IDK if it was a subconscious risk management thing or what. I do find myself wishing I had more power though on those days. I try to remind myself to rebalance but always forget.

Earnings reports for these companies are coming out soon within 10-30 days for some of these companies like ORC, XAN, TWO, NYMT, and MFA. I feel like the situation with corona is only going to get worse and if more people get laid off then more people can't pay mortgage which can affect these companies that own real estate in apartment buildings, housing, malls, shopping centers, and hotels, etc...

I feel like people will ride these earnings report and get in because of FOMO which can make the price rise but if unemployment is increasing and people cant pay mortgage than who is going to be paying these companies? IMO I feel like these earnings reports are not going to meet expectations and make the stock drop.

Aren't these the type of stocks that could give you the most bang for your buck if you invest while they're low and then just hang on once they're at pre-crash levels? Or is there something I'm overlooking as a complete beginner?

Issuance of the RoD now requires the MTDEQ to finalize a financial bond calculation within 40 days. Once the bond is submitted and accepted, it will pave the way for the potential commencement of construction at Black Butte.

The Company‚Äôs subsidiary concurrently received its preliminary Air Quality Permit and a Montana Pollution Discharge Elimination System (MDPES) permit.

Commenting on this significant milestone, Sandfire America‚Äôs CEO and VP of Project Development, Rob Scargill, said: ‚ÄúThe issuance of the RoD by the MTDEQ is a clear indication that the State of Montana is a good place to invest and create new jobs. Our project design robustly meets and exceeds some of the strictest environmental requirements for mining worldwide and demonstrates that 21st Century mining and environmental excellence can go hand-in-hand.

‚ÄúWe are now looking forward to completing the Black Butte Feasibility Study, progressing project funding options and, subject to a positive Final Investment Decision, building what we expect to become a showcase mine with state-of-the-art technology that we will all be very proud of.‚Äù

Sandfire America Senior Vice President, Jerry Zieg, said: ‚ÄúBlack Butte Copper will represent mining innovation at its best. We are embracing accountability and being responsible custodians of our environment. We are continuing to engage with our communities and creating a new model for sustainable value for all our stakeholders.‚Äù

The RoD comes with stipulations consistent with the Company‚Äôs planned staged approach to development and environmental protection. The RoD and stipulations can be found on MT DEQ‚Äôs website at http://deq.mt.gov/Public/eis.

The stipulations require an incremental bonding approach allowing for an initial bond increment for Phase 1 development work of surface preparation of the mine site. Followed by a second bond increment to cover all underground development, mill construction, and any activities involving beneficial water use. There is also a reclamation bond calculation and final design requirement for the agency modified alternative closure plan, before the second increment of bonding and any Phase 2 development work or mining.

In a press release released by the MT DEQ, Director Shaun McGrath said, ‚ÄúDEQ staff thoroughly analyzed this project and applied the best available science. Our job is to ensure a proposed project will meet or exceed the environmental regulations set forth in law. This work has resulted in the most protective hard rock mining permit this agency has ever signed.‚Äù

The RoD comes 28 days after the MTDEQ released a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and the Montana Department of Natural Resources &amp; Conservation (MTDNRC) issued a Preliminary Determination to grant water right owners‚Äô application to modify their irrigation water rights to include leasing water for mitigation and an application by the Company for high flow water rights for the project.

The Johnny Lee deposit represents one of the highest copper grade undeveloped projects in the world with a Measured and Indicated Undiluted Resource of 10.9 million tonnes at 2.9% Cu including a Lower Copper Zone with a copper grade of 6.8%.  

This will be a relatively shallow underground mine accessed by a 1,700m decline to access first the Upper Copper Zone (60-200m or 150 to 600 feet deep) followed by additional development to reach the Lower Copper Zone (300-500m or 900 to 1,500 feet deep).

The Mine Operating Permit includes the environmental framework to design a clean, safe modern mine and processing plant including:

Mine entrances and processing plant are positioned to protect the integrity of Sheep Creek and all wetlands.
The underground mine will have a portal access above the water table with minimal surface infrastructure with underground primary fans.
A drift-and-fill mining method will employ cemented paste backfill eliminating subsidence and placing almost half of the tailings back underground.
The other half of the tailings will be safely stored in a HDPE double-lined cemented tailings facility as a dry solid.
The operation will utilize a conventional process of crush-grind-froth flotation processing.
Sealed containers will be used for transporting concentrate to smelters, removing dust generation points during transit.
Mine water is used for process water which is constantly recycled. 
Mine closure will include removal of all surface facilities, reclamation of any disturbed land to comparable utility and stability, and sealing of the Cemented Tailings Facility in a double-liner and followed by addition of soil and revegetation.
No perpetual water treatment is required.
Feasibility Study

All the technical studies have now been completed for the Black Butte Project Feasibility Study, which commenced in October 2018. The Company released an updated Mineral Resource in October of 2019 for use as the foundation for the Feasibility Study. The timing for completion of the Feasibility Study may be delayed due to the global health and financial crisis caused by COVID-19. The Company will provide a further update when better information is available.

itwasthekids	1586400345	"Hello all, I hope you and your bank accounts have been staying safe and healthy during these strange times. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you may have noticed, there have been some changes to the sub lately. Most prominently, flairs are now required for posts. Branching off of that, there are now new flairs to use when making a post. It looks like most people have been able to figure that out, but I see any confusion on them, I may write out a quick guide.

&amp;#x200B;

In other news, there are going to be a few changes to the rules. Nothing extreme will probably change in regards to this. We mostly need to update/extend the rules to cover things that are already being enforced. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, starting this weekend, we will be tentatively opening up posts to images! The results towards the recent poll were vastly in favor of allowing images. That being said, there were some genuine concerns raised by people in response to this. Because of this, we will have a new image flair that must be selected for image posts. Also, there will be a new rule in regards to what/how images should be posted.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that this is a rather big change, and if it fails, we will go back to text only posting. However, I do feel that as a community, we should be able to share more then knowledge between each other, and I think the addition of image posting will be a healthy one for this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

In the future, I am hoping to roll out more changes. Here's a few that I had in mind to start with:

&amp;#x200B;

**Sub Icon:** Should we host a contest for this? If anybody has ideas as to what it should be, or anyone who could make one for us, please feel free to message me :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Awards:** Some people here make some very good DD posts, and some very good advice posts. Personally, I think we should have a unique way to reward them. If anybody has ideas for award names/designs, please reach out to me with your idea, maybe we could hold a contest for these as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I said this before, but if you have any concerns about this sub, or any ideas for improving it, PLEASE reach out to me. I would genuinely love to hear from you no matter what you have to say :)

But after googling the words in the Press Release MY understanding is that they are starting the process of exchanging old senior notes for new ones and or sending new term agreements to the current holders of the senior notes. 

Probably should've said this first but senior notes are a bond a company will issue that takes precedence over other debts IF a company goes bankrupt. so the fact they are increasing the percent  return has to be good right? Time to check out the 10-k's. DO YOUR OWN DD AND TRY TO GOOGLE. 

I have no idea how this will effect the stock but if you want to figure it out more these are the definitions i read. Just send me a PM when you figure it out I'm going to bed.

HOWEVER, it has a 8% senior debt note maturing in 2042 that trades under the ticker MFO.  This is down only 20%  from it's high.  Granted, this gets priority in liquidation, but there should be an increased risk in the debt that should cause a loss of value.

Insider activity 4/02/2020

&amp;#x200B;

SEC Source Form 3: SEC Insider1-4/21 (another public insider info but more valuable than the one above).

&amp;#x200B;

More than 25 analysis is heavily intrigued by this stock leading between a HODL &amp; underperformed. While underperformed might sound bad, but it sounds heavily attractive to those interested in the long term since it has found a clear bottom at 0.23

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Cons\*\*: 

&amp;#x200B;

Their EPS has been crushed over the number of quarters especially most recently. However, 2019 appears to shed some light on improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Common questions I will be answering below:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1) Long or short? I would do either or

&amp;#x200B;

2) Is it a good time to buy now or wait? Hell yes, it's a good time to buy. But if you're that cautious, wait till 0.40 &amp; in fact, if someone is planning to buy now, 0.40 is the safe exit.

&amp;#x200B;

3) How long should I hold? I can't answer that. I always believe in the rule of thumb never get too greedy. Things such as public offering (not to be confused with direct offering), the decision for r / s, or notices should always be kept on the lookout if the tides change. As the saying goes, what comes up must come down. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) How certain are you? About 95% certain. The only uncertainty would be if any sort of news announces otherwise that would make me change my mind or short it. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) Are you in it now? No, I will be buying it in the morning most likely, or observe for an open window opportunity for a dip.

&amp;#x200B;

6) \*\*Where can I learn your methods?\*\* or... ""I'm a newb, I don't know what I'm doing"". In a nutshell, I was once like you; clueless, young &amp; dumb and didn't know jack squat in the days of playing an OTC such as DCPN. A had a cup of coffee between me and a rich fella a long time ago at the time I was a bum nearly with no clear insight. He noticed something about me that most didn't; he said I was very analytical and I like figuring stuff out. There, he mentioned, ""ya know, analytical or over-analyzing is a good trait for trading"". He smiled and I didn't understand a damn word he was talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I've researched many top dog traders high and low, including notorious Tim Sykes. What they would teach you is old tricks with bells and whistles in either some form triangle scheme matter roping you into paying for a class that teaches you barely minimum what you can learn yourself on the interwebs. The only exceptional knowledgable thing you can learn from an entity or a person is the preferred and respected Stephen Dux. 

&amp;#x200B;

Number one, don't pay shit. Excuse my language but I can't emphasize this enough. Don't even pay for auto-alerts subs either. Because those things are already ahead of the game before you. To be currently IN THE GAME is having an active live scanner you make yourself, a reputable discord (such as TradingKingEric a well respected Stocktwit user), or system that has an accurate real-time scanner. As far as understanding when to enter or exit, I highly recommend watching The Secret Mindset on youtube; they will teach you the basics. If you're not a candle guy, then you're a chart guy (like me ;) ) it's either one or the other no matter if you're a day trader, short, or long. 

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long does it take for you to review these things? 2 hours and backtracking past &amp; present. It can be slightly exhausting. It would be nice if some folks would accommodate me some credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

8) Which one are you buying? Kinda torn between BNGO &amp; CDEV. I personally feel CDEV might be it because it's more controllable versus something too quick and too loose like BNGO being volatile. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Other questions related to the chart:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What's with the lines? What do they mean?\*\* It's a style I have been studying for the past two years called EMA; I use 4 settings that help me understand the chart's strengths and weaknesses whether day trading, short term, or long term. If you look at the webull chart, that color line red (the 99ema) is essential like bread and water. If that falls below that line, it's like driving a bike with a busted wheel ready to crash and burn, but it can also be used as a dip-buy tactic as well whether day trading or long term trading.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Other honorable mentions: 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I want to make things very clear. I don't like looking at OTC/OTK but there's one I did make an exception of looking at because it's becoming noticed, intriguing in chart behavior, &amp; point of interest from business to business perspective. \*\*DECN\*\* has been a sleeping dead cat for a long time. The fact it's becoming a booming ticker regarding covid-19 is a clear sign for a point of interest. For those entering or still holding, I highly recommend a safeguard exit in case something goes south falling bellow 0.20. DECN shows a clear bullish flag on the daily chart and the intraday chart on any time frame (i.e. 5min-15min) leads me to believe it's promising. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

BNGO - Now, I haven't heard from this little guy in a while until I noticed some activity overnight the same thing with CDEV. It's found a bottom HODL at 0.26, the potential minimum gap at 0.77, and a max gap that can be aimed possibly 1.3. The reason I'm saying 1.3 because I'm being mindful about the past it struck above $3 in the past which means there's still bag holders in the past ready to unload once the stock explodes again ready to sell to either profit/average out. BNGO also appears to be fully squeezed out from the bears or aka just are fed up with it judging from the MACD.

Cannacure holds a cultivation license and a processing license and is in the works of getting a sales license to sell under their own in house brand. We all know cultivating weed and expecting to turn a profit is a fools errand in this market, so the company does not focus on that, but it is very important. Instead, CannaCure is focussed on processing. They currently operates 2 large scale extraction machines, and has 4 more installed, approved for use, and awaiting manufacturer commissioning of vital components. Once operational this will give them the largest oil extraction capacity in Canada. 

Now, this is what I like the most about this company. They make money by operating. They aren't buying weed, extracting it, and flipping it for a profit. No, their model is much smarter. They will enter into a contract with another company, and that company is billed for any material used in processing, as well as a fee for each process. To my knowledge they are currently fulfilling 2 active contracts, one for edible oil, and another very, very large contract with a company called Cronos Group. This contract is for vape pens, and a considerable number of them over 2 years. Remember when I said they get paid for each process? Let me tell you, there are a lot of processes to take raw cannabis biomass and make a ready to go vaporizer tip. And the only expense incurred by the company is operating expense and expanding capacity with assets. 

I mentioned the cultivation was important. The reason for this ties in with their sales license and a bit of off the record stuff I'll try to spell out. They cultivate a small amount, and have been for a while. They also have a small group of employees who oversee product development. I am somewhat bound on what I can say about this product but, but I can tell you that it is new and innovative, and there isnt really anything comparable to it available right now. It is considered a proprietary process, and the product will be sold under the company's pending sales license. 

Now, let's talk money. The company reported a modest $4m in earnings for Q1 this year, which, if you read between the lines in their earnings report, does not include revenue from the cronos deal. This also includes the costs incurred from procuring additional extraction and refinement machinery in Q4 2019. This means that, into this year and next, the company is all but guaranteed to post rising profits (there are no sure things, of course). It is also worth noting that, to my knowledge, the company is still producing and shipping vape pens to the nationwide cannabis stores. 

Tl;dr $CANN has reached ATHs of $0.60-0.70 twice before, without reporting any profits. Now the company is operational, reporting positive revenue, and is in a 2 year production contract. They are at $0.135 right now, and I would consider any price under 0.30 to be a buy. Consider holding this stock for up to a year.

If this thing gaps up like I believe it will sell \~50% of your position at the open, or in pre market to realize some good profits. The let the other half of your position ride out the news. This both lets you realize profits and protects your downside incase the news is not good (fingers crossed it is and it moons).

I would also suggest putting either a stop loss or trailing stop on the remaining half of the shares that you are letting ride out the news. This will allow you to mitigate your risk and protect your profits. Happy trading and good luck tomorrow!

I see they are doing a private placement in Canada at .065 a share and are currently trading at .05.

JohnnyLakefront	1587480865	"So DECN made an announcement today. [Here's the link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decn-updates-progress-genviro-covid-131500047.html)

Most important thing to note here is that not only are we getting extremely close to FDA EUA, but we're also going to get more information on orders.  FDA EUA, and information on product orders... this will be a huge announcement. 

They also go on to note that older tests that are being used today pale in comparison to their tests, in that not only are their tests far less intrusive and painful than some of the tests that are being widely used today, but get results in a small fraction of the time (15 seconds). 

Our system is overwhelmed, being able to get patients out any faster is a huge plus.

They also mention that they're nearing completion of the FDA EUA process for their at-home kit. This means their at home kit has been bench tested and are ready to present. 

I also went over their last announcement, and there's a small blurb that many glossed over: 

""COMPANY BEGINS SCALE PURCHASES OF GENVIRO!‚Ñ¢ COMPONENTS, CREATING PACKAGING USING FDA EUA LABELING GUIDANCE, APPLICATION IN PROCESS FOR GENVIRO!‚Ñ¢"" 

The company is confident they will receive EUA, and have already started the packaging process.

**These tests are coming, now is the time to get in**

edit:

Aw shit. **THIS** is big news.... [The FDA has begun granting EUA for covid-19 home test kits.](https://www.foxnews.com/science/fda-authorizes-first-at-home-coronavirus-test) **Everything is falling into place**

We know there's an announcement coming on Thursday that will cover issues like FDA EUA, and bulk orders.... This is like being able to buy a lottery ticket, knowing it's a winner in just 2 days."	DECN news today	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g5gnw5/decn_news_today/

-A SEC, audited filer 
-Uplisting to OTCQB

-Just reported 2019 audited net income of over $10 million
-Trading at ONLY 2.5% (lol) of forecasted 2020 revenues of around $24 million 

The company is processing $3M in Brewery and Cannabis purchase orders and 2 orders have been delivered in February 2020. There are 3 more orders that are scheduled to be delivered and installed in March and April 2020.    

The company has a contract to fulfill $7M in cannabis extraction orders for 2020 and 2 of the cannabis orders are in process, along with $2M in pending orders in Hong Kong and California. 

Jef Lewis, CEO, stated, ‚ÄúSince the company went public, we are receiving new orders almost daily. We are working with 5 new locations; 1) Incline Village ‚Äì Lake Tahoe,  2) Paso Robles-California, 3) Hong Kong, 4) a restaurant chain in Virginia and 5) a brewing company in Ohio. We have manufacturing to complete with 2 Mini-CBD Coldwater Extraction Systems and 6 orders on the production floor in order to make room for the new orders. There is a large order in Oakland-California that is next in line for completion.‚Äù 

BrewBilt is bulging at the seams and will need to find additional manufacturing space to keep up with the purchase orders. At this rate the company will exceed its revenue expectations in June 2020 and possibly double its $12M expectations for 2020."	BBRW - Here‚Äôs why you should invest.

co2_druid	1587475449	"Here's the deal: oil is not going to be doing well in the next little bit of time. Prices are going lower than ever.

Transport companies that offer storage for oil (tankers) are going to do really well over the next week. Dry shipping companies are going to go up a bit as well because of FOMO and people not knowing what they own, but don't fall for the trap of certain other companies that like to rise when oil tankers do and then crash when people realize what they are.

I'm not going to tell you ""OMG TOPS rocket ship 5+ PT by EOW"" or other pumping nonsense, but if you want a stock to ride up through the next few days and then turn a nice profit this stock is a perfect opportunity right now, between both market conditions and trading patterns and the actual business the company is in becoming more and more necessary and the hype surrounding it.

""On December 27, 2018, AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with **Alpha Capital Anstalt** (the ‚ÄúPurchaser‚Äù).

&amp;#x200B;

Then I googled ""Alpha Capital Anstalt"" and I read this from an SEC press release:

 "" On March 8, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint in an ongoing civil action in which the SEC alleges that numerous individuals and associated entities participated in microcap schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales. 

On February 6, 2019, the SEC obtained final consent judgements as to Miami-based investor Mark Groussman; Melechdavid Inc., a company of which Groussman is President; and **Alpha Capital Anstalt**, a Lichtenstein-based hedge fund.""

icysauceman69	1588239151	"For the past 4 days UAVS has been rumored to have landed a deal with Amazon. 

At first, it was just skepticism, due PR saying they received a ‚Äúpurchase order from a major ecommerce company. Representing significant new revenue....‚Äù

However, yesterday, a video was leaked early yesterday morning. It was an instructional video of how to unbox a new AGEagle drone. What makes this significant? 
1. The video starts with the logo of both companies AGEagle and Amazon side by side, implying collaboration.
2. The website it was found on was morganchillcott.com. She seems to make instructional video for companies as a hustle. 
3. The video was marked as unlisted meaning the only people who could view it at the time, were the people who were sent the link. 
4. Since the leaking, the video was not taken down. It‚Äôs just the privacy setting on the video was fixed to where no one could see the video. As a matter of fact you can‚Äôt even go to MorganChillcott.com as the website has currently been made private. The seems to have just been a mistake made on the video creators side of things 
5. The most important of all. Morgan Chilcott is the daughter of the founder of the company Bret Chilcott. You can see him in a family vacation video she has on her YouTube page. If you check her Facebook you can see she is from Neodesha, Kansas where the company was founded and is headquartered. It all checks out. Seems like her father wanted to give her another gig for her video making business. 

Now one could say this was just a move to pump their stocks. However, the video was uploaded in mid-February. Unless they were planning this all along for the past two months. Which seems a little far fetched. I imagine the daughter getting into trouble with the SEC for misleading investors or insider trading. Especially since she is the daughter of the founder of the company.

I‚Äôve also read things online about activity on the CEO Barrett Mooney‚Äôs LinkedIn page. That seems to be just skepticism. 

Another thing I haven‚Äôt read anyone talking about is, if they landed this deal with Amazon, how tremendous it would be to be the supplier of drones or drone parts to Amazon during the COVID-19 pandemic. A time when people want as little contact as possible with others in fear of contracting the virus. Seriously I think that is a huge deal. Which is why I bought 4000@.994.

Seems like energy is on the fly trends last week and this week. Not only that, but they've been keeping a steady consistency. I've been taking a look at AMPY that contains both a good consistency and after-hours activity. Opening broke all resistance from 0.97 &amp; original support was 0.91. I highly recommend looking for a re-entry point at 1.39 considering the volume for yesterday was soft at 3M. The gap has yet to be filled with a reasonable price target of $3 which is very ever so nice. Out of most of the tickers, this is by far a strong reasonable reputable energy company as well. Their quarter report makes up for the Q12020 and overall favorable.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

PB 0.05 ranked 11th which is incredibly good.

Reminds me of FCEL back in October 2019

Debt to asset 50% which is fair

Dividends which is also a plus

Overly sold more than 100%

Likely a continuation

Support 0.90

0.94 was the confirmation for a bullish cup'n handle that maintained a HODL.

[Robin Track seems to show a demand + Price Strength](https://ibb.co/3hK4tP2)

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: 

Challenging resistance maybe 1.9 for it to break higher

Needs to break 1.7 for a confirmation

If the continuation isn't consistent, the fail-safe exit at most would be 1.3

All the things I've read about VAL seems like its heading towards bankruptcy. Part of me wants to forget about this and move on, but it looks like another WLL. And that went from 10c to over a dollar.

Anyone think VAL is worth a few hundreds in hope it's last minute struggles will turn into tremendous gains?

OIL Moves Higher
 
GOOGL, TSLA, &amp; MSFT Blow Away Numbers
 
Russell the Big Winner
 
 
Today‚Äôs market got off to a dramatic start when already +200 in the futures, GILD came out with positive news on the NIAID trial for Remdesivir and we added an additional 250 to the open.  The Fed FOMC was a nonevent, but after the Q&amp;A, it became obvious that the money train would keep rolling, the Gold moved higher. The final numbers were impressive with DJIA +532.31 (2.21%), NASDAQ +306.98 (3.57%), S&amp;P 500 +76.12 (2.66%), the Russell, the big winner +62.68 (4.83%) and the DJ Transports +221.30 (2.63%).  Market internals were strong with NYSE 7:1 and NASDAQ 4:1 and for the first time in recent memory, volume was higher.  The DJIA was 24:6 with WMT the only double-digit loser -30 DPs while on the upside we had V +72, AAPL +62, AXP &amp; BA +53, and MSFT +52 (and more coming in the morning).

Tonight‚Äôs closing comment video
https://youtu.be/el59hhpILHY
 
 
SECTORS: Earnings played a big part in today‚Äôs market.  After the close last night, we heard from Google and it was a beat on revenues and after closing $1232.59 -38.27 and finished the evening $1267 +35.  It continued higher today and finished $1345.02 +112.43 (9.12%).  After today‚Äôs close we heard from a few of the other FAANG names.  FaceBook was a miss both top and bottom but the guidance they gave on ad spending was upbeat.  After closing 194.19 +11.28 it to 214.57 + another $20.  MSFT beat on both numbers and after closing $177.43 +7.62 it shot higher to 186.52 before closing $181.25 + 3.82.  TSLA was the last one to report and the stock has been on a tear from a low of $350 in mid-March to close today $800.51 +31.39 and put out a profitable quarter and talked about it big truck.  The stock moved to $886.89 and closed $870.30 for a total gain of $101.88 (13.25%).
 
And, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY is clearly Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR)  reported that it had a 100% survival of its patients treated with CAP-1002.  All were in deep respiratory distress and 5 of the 6 were on ventilators.  Four of the six have already been discharged.  The stock, which has been reversed twice, most recently 1:10, and the last time 1:50 finished the day $8.50 +6.09 (252.7%) Clearly a home run.  But with a side note since the adjusted high after both reverses is $2,720.  Quite a destroyer of equity.
 
 
FOOD SUPPLY: was LOWER with TSN +.74, BGS -.75, FLO -.47, CAG -.19, MDLZ -.55, KHC +.81, CALM -.79, JJSF +10.71 (8.48%), SAFM -3.43, and LANC +3.09.
 
 
BIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB -.46, ABBV +1.20, REGN -17.26 (3.27%), ISRG +16.27 (3.23%), GILD +6.37, MYL +1.06, TEVA +.36, VRTX +1.54, BHC +.95, INCY -1.71, ICPT +1.07, LABU +1.36, and IBB $126.55 +1.74 (1.39%).
 
CANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.18, CGC +.46, CRON +.06, GWPH -.18, ACB +.01, PYX +.03, NBEV +.03, CURLF +.30 (6.67%), KERN -.21 and MJ $12.44 +.18 (1.47%).

 
DEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +8.17, RTX +3.39, GD +.71, TXT +1.48, NOC -12.70, BWXT -.07, TDY +12.71 and ITA $161.85 +7.91 (5.14%).
 
RETAIL was HIGHER with WMT the big loser again -3.89 (3.04%), M +.26, JWN -.02, KSS +.66, DDS -.45, JCP -.017, TGT +.85, TJX +4.90 (9.98%), RL +2.53, UAA +.19, LULU +7.96, TPPR +1.24 (7.7%), CPRI +1.68 (11.17%), and XRT $37.92 +1.10 (2.99%).
 
FAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +112.43 (9.12%), AMZN +104.12 (4.5%), AAPL +13.72 (4.92%), FB +31.66 (17.31%), NFLX +8.68, NVDA +9.44, TSLA +101.80 (13.25%), BABA +7.15, BIDU +3.12, CMG +26.64, BA +9.65, CAT +5.28, DIS +6.51 (6.13%) and XLK $93.45 +5.25 (5.95%).
  
FINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS 5.49, JPM +3.71, BAC +1.31, MS +1.43, C +4.04 (8.56%), PNC +5.00, AIG +2.52 (9.97%), TRV +1.72, AXP +9.16 (10.39%), V +13.74 (8.02%) and XLF $23.38 +.66 (2.9%).
 
OIL, $15.06 +2.72. Oil was higher again today and seems to be making a decent show of making an important bottom. Tonight, it is higher again trading 15.95 +.89.  The stocks were also much higher with gains of between 6% on the big names and as much as 30% on some of the small ones.  XLE closed $39.95 +3.77 (5.63%).
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,713.40 -8.80. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We have spent the last 3 days consolidating the gains and hit $1,720 today.  I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 yesterday I was a buyer.  We took the downside move this morning and averaged down @ $1.06, and they closed $1.61.  We are also long NEM.
 
BITCOIN: closed $8825 +1045. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today‚Äôs action was a continuing move higher.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.60 +1.20 today.
 
 
Tomorrow is another day.

YUFALLING4IT	1588209920	"Ticker is SLNG üá®üá¶ SLGWF üá∫üá∏


I would like some input on my new purchase.   I am new to the world of penny stocks (started Monday) and I hope you like my pick and buy.  This company got my attention  because recent increase in volume.



*About the company:* SLNG a US based cannabis CPG company.  The main strategy is to buy proven high demand brands in highly competitive markets and put those brands through their network of 3000 retailers.


Market cap is 26 million.  They reported they have 10 million in cash.  Have since raised 17 million and 4.5 million coming from deal closing.  So total cash position is over 30 million.   Revenue was 27 million last quarter. 


__________________________________


*Competitive advantage:* Cannabis companies burn through money because expansion is expensive.  Main cost are setting up growing and retail operations.


SLNG has no growing operations or retail  stores.  They buy cannabis, process, package and distribute brands.  These brands have risen to the top in cut throat mature markets and acquired by SLNG.  


They are also global with their vape hardware business.  Firefly for dry herb and O.PenVape for oils (#2 top selling brand of almond time)


_______________________________



*Partnerships:*  Canopy growth.  They have a joint venture in Canada together.   Canopy also owns warrants in SLNG.  


Trulieve,  TRUL is very highly regarded in the USA cannabis space.   Probably top 3 company in the USA.


They have several other partnerships like Cookies (best brand in the world IMO).   Cookies is the only brand they don't own they just distribute.


___________________________________



*Management:*  The company is run by 2 young guys who built #2 cannabis company in Canada and sold it in 2015.  They seem like very smart and honest guys who don't hype their stock unfortunately (unlike me).



_________________________________


*Possible Red flags:*  I found they have some cheap paper when the company was smaller in 2017.  Shares at 0.05 cents.  


I don't think this is a problem because in 2019 they hit 2.90 a share and I am sure the paper has been  flushed out.  If you didn't sell in the high 2 dollar range why would you sell in the 11 to 13 cent range. 


Management voluntarily entered into a lock up agreement until September (stock was 80 cents at the time)


The other red flag is selling pressure.  SLNG has not popped like most other cannabis stocks.   Could be a laggard play  due to someone unloading a large position.  Why?  



_______________________________



*Comparables:*  There is only one other major cannabis CPG company in the USA,  that company is called Origin House   


That company sold in January for 1.1 BILLION.  They have similar revenue to SLNG but SLNG had better financials.  *SLNG trading at 36 million.*

TheBazaarTrades	1588208581	"I've decided to make a little donation page. Each post made on the tickers I find likely valuable will be posted below each post. I sincerely hope I have helped many go green, practice, improve, and understand without having to hold people's hands (don't be the person to ask for a fish, BE the FISHER!). In short, I apologize if I don't respond apologize often enough of the common questions I receive whether to advise hold or sell; the reason being is I don't want to give a FOMO, I don't want to give someone a sense of regret, the only some form of safeguard I could give is providing simple resistance/support and reminding you effortlessly to follow self common sense not to be too greedy, or holding longer than normal.

I'm in no way shape or form a professional trader or a legally advised pro trader that can't promise loss or gains, but what I am good at in general is analyzing potential. For that, I hope 

These two charts I use are to study gap/swing/outside bars the other is to follow the art of Fibonacci which comes from Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo who was a mathematician. I've tested so many tools and so many that failed. At the end of the day... the chart set up works that help me give a clear insight if it's worth playing the flip coin or not; no emotions, no worry, just set it and let it bake mentality. The idea of day trading can be stressful which instead I've devoted the simplicity of reviewing activities via midnight - aka thinkorswim aka Ameritrade. It's clean, simple, and gives me all the time needed to review and pinpoint potential runners affirming the move before it happens, NOT after.

The reason I don't focus on OTC/OTK because well it's just from personal experience. There's absolutely no insight about any sort of confirmation unless it's a valuable press release source such as FDA, a buy out point of interest such as apple or people's gas, or even goverment related.

In short, I thank you all for following me. I thank you all for the kind words giving me that innovation enjoyable push. Below, feel free to drop a tax-deductable donation &lt;3

Oil prices went up 14% today, the stock price followed similarly. It hit a low of $0.24 and is half way back to my price target of $0.35. Others are confident that it will hit $.40+ but I am more conservative.

I think that is a good (short term) trade. The factors that move its price are quite straightforward and oil stocks are very hot right now as they recently hit a pretty hard bottom.

People always talking about ‚ÄúIf we get some PR we are on the moon!‚Äù But this one is quite simple. If oil starts to see more demand, there‚Äôs no reason it would drop significantly.

sliight	1588192939	"The posts on this remind me of politics. No clue which side would be considered  left or right, but it seems like a lot of people can't be swayed from their stance. Whether it's all in or all against..

My question is for the independents... What's your next buy target?  If no new press over next few days I feel like $1.40 is a good target. Figure 20% of what I'm willing to commit, then next 20% for every nickel to keep averaging down.

I don't see the heal light generating much buzz other than small jumps when press hits, but nothing huge until they release news on human trials starting, assuming they get to that point. (For the record I hope it becomes the next amazing medical device and I'm ok missing out on a massive run)

So I'm looking at the next bump from the 500k tests reporting that they arrived. Figure then target of $1.70 to sell 20% of shares I obtained then every 10 cents run up.

This stock seems to have regained it's consistency again and keeps giving nice pops of profit.  I like that it's slower and suits swing trades better since I don't have time to watch like a day trader would.

Just so everyone knows, the only reason I told you about UAVS and Amazon, confirming it, is because I know the struggle of trying to get money from stocks. Some of us are great, others aren‚Äôt, so this is like a head-start. In these times, we need to help one-another. 

Some may doubt this post, thinking it‚Äôs a lie, but it really isn‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt believe me, I do understand. However, I would not risk other people‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of dollars, because I know the struggle it takes and the hardships one endured to make it, especially knowing ‚Äúwhat if it doesn‚Äôt work out.‚Äù

I cannot confirm how much the stock will increase after the Amazon and UAV announcement, but I can confirm that they are announcing their partnership tomorrow morning at 11:00am.

stapleosprey_the_god	1588185917	"This is a pump and dump, nothing more then that. I am writing this post in order to tell you that I believe this stock will soon be suspended, and you should get out while you can.

I am not an owner of this stock, nor do I want to be. I heard about it 3 days ago, and upon conducting my own DD was unsatisfied with what I saw. They employ less then 10 people, and are attempting to partner with the biggest e-commerce firm on the planet. Amazon could easily buy them; why havent they? Most likely because this is a front company just like DECN was, pushing products that don‚Äôt exist.  


Then theres the video that the CEO‚Äôs daughter made private this morning. This was a PR stunt, plain and simple. Having the Amazon logo appear next to the AG Eagle one intrinsically means nothing, but will get investors hyped and drive up the price.

Compare a previous UAVS press release to one of DECNS; they both mention that they are going to sell to large companies but never actually mention one by name. DECN just said that ‚Äúseveral Fortune 500 companies have reached out to us‚Äù and UAVS said ‚Äúa large company that already has a foundation in the drone delivery business‚Äù. These sentences are crafted to make investors think that they are partnering with a big company, but never explicitly stating it.

xwingfighterred2	1588184702	Just wanted to say thank you to everyone here who pushes for sound and careful reasoning. I tried my first penny stock test and sold uavs at a profit of. 35 a share. Could have made a lot more if I waited, but following the advice to temper expectations and go for 30% profits was awesome. I didn't win as big as I could have, but I am happy that I profited and feel that while I didn't win as big, a cautious approach means I won't lose as much, either. I made some money that I didn't have yesterday and for that I'm happy and excited for future opportunities ahead. Thanks for the good information here about not getting filthy rich overnight but that penny stocks are a plausible play when it makes sense.

Retail took a **HUGE DUMP** late March, beginning of April.   It's gotta come back a bit.  Everyone got a $1200 check from Uncle Sam.  When the stores reopen people are gonna want to go buy shit.

I bought Tanger Outlets (SKT). Technically not a penny stocks now, but was when I nabbed it at $4.50

Reasoning... People are gonna want to buy shit. The ladies gonna want them Coach handbags. But, in tough times people go for bargains. Tanger is exclusively outlet malls.  

The big fish in the pond for retail REIT is Simon Properties (SPG).  Tanger just stole the CEO of Simon.  This is like being Shasta Cola and getting the CEO of Coke.

My guess (pure speculation) is there will be a buyout/merger.  Simon and Tanger already co-own a couple malls."	Retail is starting to slowly rebound	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gaek1n/retail_is_starting_to_slowly_rebound/

Broke through today on big news that they are extending their lease on a valuable group of gold mines in Idaho permanently through the life of their production. Market cap around $5 million, no debt or dilution. Plenty of room to run, with many more potential catalysts on the way: working on locking up additional funding, joint venture with a mining company, deal in place to improve access road to the mines, production season starting once the snow clears out in the Idaho mountains. 

To top it all off, its one of the cleanest technical charts out there. Steady accumulation, and strong support rejecting short moves every time. It's not going to give you the 10x moonshot in 2 days, but I think it's a very good bet to double in the near future, with plenty more upside after that."

VectorVictor9er	1588944449	Just my opinion. Yes, it will drop the price of the stock today. But long term, what does that mean? I think the company just signed lots of deals with major players and is getting over 2 mil from the offering to do everything right. This is their big chance. No mistakes. Hire the right people and produce the shows the right way. Whatever that entails, they needed money to do it. Sure the stock price will take a hit today, but long term it is only going to go that much higher. I got in early, saw huge gains, see some losses yesterday and today but I'm still in the green. I'm buying in more later today on the dip. I believe this is the long term hold. No pump and dump here with these guys.

Actual DD doesn't matter to this sub, just popularity of ticker names + upvotes.

RichChigga19	1588905383	"We can all agree that the conference call was a disappointment. Well, this is how I would have handled the MVIS call if I were the CEO of MVIS. 

Call starts, epic rock music starts playing instead of the gay piano music of the real call. This gets people hyped up and automatically raises the stock price by 20 or 30 cents. 

A really hot lady gets on and says in a sexy voice, thank you MVIS stockholders for attending our conference call, we will begin shortly. Now moaning sex noises are added to the rock music as the announcer starts making out with her hot assistant live on air.

Rock music fades into guitar solo and finally an explosion. Then the CEO of MVIS (me) takes the mic and says ""Good evening investors old and new, we have some VERY SPECIAL news for you today... and a very special guest"" - shares gap up, people start buying like crazy. 

I then hand the mic to my special guest. ""Yes indeed we do"", he says in an oddly familiar voice.

It takes shareholders mere seconds to realize that this is the voice of none other than Bill Gates the founder and former CEO of Microsoft, during which time stock price has already cleared $2. 

""At this point we would like to announce a merger of MVIS and Microsoft"" says Bill Gates, ""and we will be purchasing the technology of MVIS to use in our Hololens for... 1 Billion Dollars"".

At this point the shares are trading well north of the $5 mark. ""But there's more"" Gates continues. ""We will be folding the entirety of MSFT common stock into MVIS shares ASAP to reflect this merger"" 

immediately in exchanges across the world MSFT stops trading and is replaced with none other than MVIS at an initial stock offering of $300 a share. All across the world those intelligent enough to have invested in MVIS celebrate as newly minted millionaires. 

I take the mic back from Bill. ""Thanks Bill"" I say. ""But there's more. We have just come out with a vaccine for the Coronavirus."" Insantly trading of MVIS shares halts because of the insane amount of people buying it crashing the exchange and hitting all the circuit breakers. 

Suddenly a helicopter noise is heard in the background growing louder and louder. ""Uhhh, what's happening?"" I say and even Bill looks confused. However, as the Helicopter lands, who emerges from inside it but Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon...

He snatches the mic from Bill and says, ""I would like to announce that I Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon have just taken up a 50% stake in MVIS and UAVS."" 

UAVS moons.

Finally we all crack open a Beer live on the call and talk about our favorite penny stocks and have investors call in to ask questions, or even just to shoot the shit with us. A hologram of Warren Buffet appears using MVIS technology to congratulate us on our wise investments. Everyone makes a profit, even people that didn't buy MVIS as the poor all around the world are assigned 1 share of MVIS each (which is worth well over $10,000 at this point) as an economic stimulus, saving the global economy."

SECTORS: Earnings played a part in today‚Äôs market again.  The follow-thru from yesterday‚Äôs numbers pushed PYPL +18 (14%) and LYFT +5.66 (21.7%).  Today‚Äôs numbers were a mix with the hospitality booking firms the biggest losers.  BKNG was a miss and after closing $1443.91 +65 it fell as low as 1,381 -63 but bounced back to close $1,440 ‚Äì only $3.91.  Trip Advisor (TRIP) was not quite so lucky.  They missed top and bottom lines and after closing $18.72 +.63 it fell to $17.35 and finished $17.86 -.86, but it is down 40% YTD.  
 
Uber reported horrendous numbers and it had closed $30.93 +3.11 on the strength of yesterdays LYFT numbers but the losses increased, and the company posted a loss of $2.9 billion vs. $1.4B expected and the stock fell to $29.50 before the CEO came on the call and spread some BS pixie dust about the last 4 weeks improving, but at the same time withdrew the guidance going forward.  He also said that UBER Eats grew, but that they lose money on every delivery.  At that point the stock turned and ran up to $34.19 before closing $32.80 + about $5 on the day.  Unbelievable.
 
ROKU reported a beat on revenues but another loss.  The stock had closed $137.50 +9.98 and guidance is for no profit in either 2020 or 2021.  The stock sold off to $123.11 and finished $123.50 -14.00 (3.73%).

Last 2 weeks missed out on over 2k in profit on Mvis and Uavs while losing money as well. What I take from this is beware of the constant pump and dump especially during bearish market conditions.

chronogumbo	1588899331	"I've been doing this for about a month now, which sure as hell makes me a Noob. I've lost a total of $700 in that month, and have only gained $300. All of those gains came in the past 4 days. I lost the $700 on three stocks. I made the $300 on 12 stocks. 

I've learned what to pick and choose and what has a higher chance of increasing. It stopped being about ""what if it does go up and you miss it"" to ""how likely will this thing continue to go up? Does it happen often given the stocks conditions?"".

For example, I see people saying ""ZOM still has a ways to go!"". Maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't. But, given it rose 85% today, how likely is it to do that again? How likely are you to time a dip, gain entry, exit correctly, before it goes below your purchase price? How likely is a huge crash to occur at a pumped up rate?

Now look at KTOV.

Its currently in the dumped phase. It's near it's one month low. 6 months chart shows clear, increasing support week to week. Could it shit out and set a new all time low?  Of course! How likely is it to nosedive to 1/3 it's value (rip MVIS) vs say ZOM?. Much less likely. 

Yes you might lose out on that 40-50% gain once or twice, but more importantly your missing larger drops!

I sold out of GNUS before AH yesterday and made 60%. Now look at KTOV in its last pump, it jumped about 40% then went back to where it was. You lose all your profit by always going after the big wins.

lilcartivert	1588898878	I am cringing so hard with the amount of chasing and bag-holding that occurs in this sub. So many of you have literally no idea how to trade and it shows. Why would you chase a stock that is already up 70%+(looking at the people who bought ZOM in the 0.3s). Why would you keep holding a stock after it was blatantly overbought (looking at you MVIS ‚Äî RSI WAS AT 90!!!! NINETY!!!) Find a chat room like BSS and get in before the run and get out after you‚Äôve made profit (no such thing as bad profit). Don‚Äôt chase and don‚Äôt bag hold. Hit it and quit it like the stock is a one night stand. Clearly some you only get your info from this sub which will fail you 100% of the time.

Alright, let's start.. I feel like the past few weeks there's been a lot of....attachment to stocks. Particularly ones that have gone tits up. DECN, UAVS and today MVIS are all prime examples of this but there have been others that didn't have the traction that these got since they were pump and dumps. I've read countless times ""I believe in this stock"" when its going nowhere any time soon. What's odd about this is the fact that a lot of advice that I've seen on here involves *separating your emotions* from trading. It's passed around quite a bit as advice for managing losses and reducing the risk of losses and its a legitimate thing. 

One emotion that I think some of you are overlooking is hope. You see your stock tank due to bad news, or a bad report, or even a whale dropping 700k stocks at once and instead of mitigation your losses and walking away while you can, you try to justify it. You think to yourself ""oh, it'll bounce back"" or ""PR is coming in two days maybe it will shoot back up"". In some cases I'm sure that happened, MVIS *did* indeed climb back up a little bit before the CC today. But then people held on still. The same with UAVS last week. The stock tanked during the stockholders call and instead of selling off a lot of people held on and are still holding on. I see a UAVS post at least once a day talking about news. The same with DECN. 

You can't be hopeful about a stock. You're buying stock to make money. Not support the company and be its cheerleader. If that stock starts to lose value, especially at a fast rate *ditch it and move on*. There are thousands of stocks. Literally every day there are 3 or 4 that are primed to make good size gains. At least once a week lately there has been a new pump and dump. Move on. Look for the next stock. Don't be one of these people waiting for a stock to rise after a hard crash. Sell your stock and reinvest that money into something worthwhile instead of letting it sit there doing nothing for you because you lost a third or half or three quarters of your investment. GO MAKE THAT SHIT BACK! 

I hope this has been helpful for someone, or can start some conversation that will be helpful. We're all here to make money, and we need to help each other when we can. Thank you for reading."

I'll make this quick and start off by saying I'm a rookie with regard to the stock market but have done my fair share of research into smaller / ""off the radar"" companies poised with interesting opportunities and lucrative potential.

I was first introduced to NEXCF right before their big blastoff breakout, 52-week high price after news of their launch of 3D augmented reality (3D/AR) solution for online eCommerce product placement advertising.

The CEO of the company seems to have always been, most especially in recent weeks, an active member of the shareholder community and stands behind his brand. There have been plenty of online press releases detailing his investments and purchases of company shares -- and just recently purchasing nearly one million shares himself -- so buying his own stuff means things are going well and he's pretty confident about it, right?  He also regularly hosts online video conference calls where he welcomes investors and speculators to come in and chat, watch the show and ask questions -- all done in live action!  I feel like he's always been very transparent with his company practices and future plans -- which has lead me to be a firm believer of NEXCF.

Not to mention, although NEXCF is labeled as having OTC shares, their reputation precedes themselves by openly reporting acquisitions, partnerships, revenues, profits, etc.

Also looks like volume and share price have been going up somewhat steadily in recent weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I had set up a stop order for a stock when it dropped to .85 cents, however when I woke up a little after the market had opened, I saw that it sold at .70 cents. I was wondering how that happened or if I did something wrong in setting it up? For example, should I use a stop limit order instead or is that unavoidable because it only accounts for market price and not pre-market price?

Another question I had has to do with stocks like MVIS. I, like a lot of you, jumped on the train too late and got burned. I've been reading a lot of here about dumping your stocks at power hour, but I was curious about how you differentiate between which stocks to dump. For example, I currently own shares in RMBL and MARK and I want to see how they play out, but at the moment they are losing value as I bought in too high. Is that a situation where I should wait for it to go up a little and dump, or should I try and stick with it to see how it works out over the next week?

Quoted from the 8-K filed today -

Adjournment of Special Meeting
On May 7, 2020, Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúConatus‚Äù) convened and adjourned a special meeting of stockholders because a quorum was not present to conduct business at the special meeting. The special meeting will be reconvened on May 21, 2020 at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time, virtually and stockholders can register to attend the special meeting by visiting, www.proxydocs.com/CNAT by no later than May 19, 2020 at 2:00 p.m., Pacific Time. The record date for the special meeting remains March 13, 2020.

JustSomeStonksBoi	1589549329	"Trend reversal and several upcoming catalysts : SLS

&amp;#x200B;

Market cap now &lt;$20M ‚Äì should be $150M - $250M right now 

SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (SLS) is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel cancer immunotherapies for a broad range of cancer indications with TWO Phase 3 ready cancer vaccines : GPS and NPS. Both have proven to be safe and well-tolerated and achieved very impressive results so far. Impressive list of partners funding the ongoing trials.

&amp;#x200B;

GPS :

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢	In February 2020, SELLAS announced positive follow-up data from its Phase 1/2 study of GPS in CR2 AML patients. The final data show a median overall survival (OS) of 21.0 months, at a median follow-up of 30.8 months, in patients receiving GPS compared to 5.4 months in patients treated with best standard care (p-value &lt; 0.02). GPS therapy continued to be well-tolerated throughout the study. 

‚Ä¢	In February 2020, SELLAS announced the enrollment of the first patient in an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of GPS in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb‚Äôs anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab (Opdivo¬Æ), in patients with MPM.

‚Ä¢	In January 2020, SELLAS announced that it commenced patient screening for its pivotal Phase 3 REGAL study of GPS in patients with AML in CR2.

&amp;#x200B;

NPS :

‚Ä¢	In March 2020, SELLAS announced preliminary antigen-specific immune response data from a Phase 2 randomized investigator-sponsored trial of NPS in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast who are HLA-A2+ or A3+ positive, express HER2 at IHC 1+, 2+, or 3+ levels, and are pre- or post-menopausal. Preliminary data show an 11-fold increase in a CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes immune response in patients who received a single dose of NPS compared to baseline. The final data is being further analyzed by the National Institute of Health, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the study principal investigator, Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, MD, PhD of the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women‚Äôs Cancer Center, and will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.

‚Ä¢	In March 2020, SELLAS announced that final results from the efficacy and safety data analysis of the Phase 2b independent investigator-sponsored clinical trial of the combination of trastuzumab (Herceptin¬Æ) +/- NPS targeting HER2 low-expressing breast cancer patient cohorts, including patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), were recently published in the peer reviewed journal, Clinical Cancer Research. With regard to the TNBC patient cohort, the data analysis shows:

\-  Disease-free survival (DFS) landmark rate at 24 months for patients treated with NPS plus trastuzumab (n=53) was 92.6% compared to 70.2% for those treated with trastuzumab alone (n=44), a clinically and statistically significant improvement.

\-  There was a statistically significant reduction of 71.9% (p=0.01) in the frequency of clinically detected recurrences in patients treated with the combination (NPS plus trastuzumab) versus trastuzumab alone.

\-  The combination was generally well-tolerated and there were no clinicopathologic differences between the study groups.

‚Ä¢	In February 2020, SELLAS announced that it had finalized the design and plan for a Phase 3 registration-enabling study of NPS in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with TNBC in the adjuvant setting after standard treatment, following feedback from a Type C review with the FDA. SELLAS is actively pursuing out-licensing opportunities to fund and conduct the future clinical development of NPS.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Sellas got 2 very promising cancer vaccines -&gt; will get FDA approved -&gt; MOON.

Market Cap is 20 Million, shares around $3

Market Cap should be around 150 - 200 Million, SHARES ARE GONNA MOON TO MINIMUM $20

Patience will be rewarded

Garrett_OL	1589547531	"Word of advice from a former MVIS bag holder: always sell before the news and trailing stops.

Last week I was stuck on the down turn of MVIS up until their ER, I took that shit on the chin and walked out with a dirty 20% loss. I knew I was a newbie so I just chalked up my L, learned from it, and moved on.

I did a very different play for IZEA this week. Originally in at .56 early on, market open yesterday sold at .75. Mmmmmmm profit! Saw a dip to .65 on ER day?! All in, back in around 11a. Now what I did here was epic: after reaching a comfortable gain that most people would sell at (~.75 again), I placed a trailing stop order at 5%. This way, if it fell to .71, it would sell, but it‚Äôs still profits.. But it did something oh so much better, that baby MOONED! IZEA hit a tiny wall at .90 yesterday around 2:30p and dipped down just 5% and had me sell at .86 since the trailing stop essentially follows the ride up to the top! And even if it didn‚Äôt dip 5% and peaked at .94, spiraling out of control as it eventually hit rock bottom again (don‚Äôt hold through ER in a time like this, boys and girls), it would‚Äôve sold me off at .90. Hard to be mad at that, and one hell of a use of a day trade I must say.

I am still a rookie, but them is my 2¬¢. Hopefully I can help a few of you that might have felt the pain of an MVIS, UAVS, or most recently IZEA.

TL;DR: $IZEA to the MOON Monday baby, this ish is DISCOUNTED! üìà"	Early sells? Stuck holding a bag?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk8n9d/early_sells_stuck_holding_a_bag/

bforman22	1589545500	"I have seen a lot of post about the meeting today and the dilution of shares as well as if now is a good time to get in due to this stock climbing and being near ATH.

Due to the fears of the the dilution of shares, this is causing the price to drop a decent amount. Nobody will be able to agree on this. 

One of two things will happen today. Price will continue to drop a little up until meeting and then fall more once results are heard. Or two, price will continue to drop until meeting and then skyrocket back up if shareholders hear positive news. Those who are already in and are long GNUS will add as it continues to go down, those who aren‚Äôt in yet, it might be best to avoid to see meeting results.

Cons: this is a quick post so didn‚Äôt think deep, but the biggest con is that cartoons are already a big space. It may be tricky for them to make a name for themselves and make it. I‚Äôm sure there may be others but as I said, this was a quick post.

Pros: unlike most cartoons, they have partnered with big celebrities liked Jennifer Garner and Arnold Schwarzenegger and have concepts based off of Stan Lee and Warren Buffet. That can be huge. They have to deal with Mattel and will be selling at Walmart, which may expand. They will be streaming shows on Netflix, Amazon prime, Apple, Roku, Sling, Alibaba. Of course they have the Kartoon Channel.

GNUS at close had a $48 million market cap. Hard to say any future viewership, ad revenue, and toy sales are priced into that. So, there is still room to grow."	GNUS	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk85o9/gnus/

Analysts say that data is the new oil, and I have looked at many data stocks. I have a few safe buys... Microsoft, apple, and New relic, but I want to see if I can strike it big with these two: HPE and MFGP.

With HPE and HPQ, Hewlett Packard, are with good reputation, so i see this as a safe buy and I've been buying in. HPE will skyrocket in the near future, what do you think?

As for MFGP, the low entry point is enticing and the outlook looks promising. It was trading at 10 to 14 before covid-19, and now it is sitting on good news without much movement.

Before covid: hit highs of $11 -&gt; 5.42.

Cicero1982	1589538597	"Big Takeaway: The SEC has RSS feeds that can automatically notify you of a company‚Äôs filings the moment they are published. It is therefore easy to be the first to know. No need to pay for a service that does this for you. 

[Know Your SEC Forms: An SEC Filing Reference Guide for Traders and Investors (Boring But Essential!)](https://www.tradinganalysisresources.com/2020/05/know-your-sec-forms-sec-filing.html?m=1)

Overview: With the wide spread availability of trading applications there came a number of retail traders who dove into trading without knowing the power of reading and understanding company SEC filings. SEC filings can provide critical indicators (""indicators"" not ""guarantees"") as to a companies past and future performance. These documents can be an essential tool in helping an investor gauge whether to buy or sell a security. The purpose of the following entry is to provide a brief introduction to some of the most pertinent SEC Forms. 

Why Read SEC Forms?: An important part of doing your due diligence on a company before you invest is checking out their most recent and historical SEC filings. These filings, if read and assessed properly with other market signals, may be a good indicator of a companies financial strength and institutional and insider confidence. For example, a microcap or smallcap trader will want to assess how long a company can remain financially viable without releasing another offering, or perhaps, assess at what price an investor may exercise a previously issued warrant. A midcap and largecap investor might want to know what institutions and insiders are buying, and to what extent a company is growing revenue. In short, learning to read and analyze SEC Forms (combined with other market conditions) will give you a competitive advantage as a trader. 

EDGAR: There are a number of ways an investor can look up company SEC filings. However if you want to go straight to the horses mouth you go to the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system; otherwise known as ""EDGAR."" I recommend simply typing in the ticker of your choosing into the ""Fast Search"" feature. From there you can find all of a company's SEC filings. If you really wanted to get savvy you can see all of your companies SEC filings as they are instantly filed by using your favorite RSS feed app. That's how right! for your convenience the SEC has an RSS feature for practically anything you want to look for. That way you will be among the first to be alerted when a company you're tracking files with the SEC. And just to think there are websites that charge for this kind of alert feature! Like most alerting software, its just a rip off for something you can otherwise get for free.

sfdandan	1589521950	"AIM had a spike yesterday after the announcement of FDA trial approval and some nice caterpillar action in the afternoon. Bearish day, but been digging in deeper to Ampligen to uncover a few resources.

**Bold** is what I added below. From what it says here, Ampligen was the only one that worked well against a researcher generated version of SARS in an older study against other possibilities.  


Rant: yes, there are biotech companies like Bausch Health working on VIRAZOLE for COVID-19 which was mentioned to be disputable in that same study, so people, do your historical DD before trading biotech firms on coronavirus work! 

&amp;#x200B;

1. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17176632](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17176632)

&gt; A hybrid interferon, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) B/D, and a mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA interferon (IFN) inducer, Ampligen (poly I:poly C124), were the only compounds that potently inhibited virus titres in the lungs of infected mice as assessed by CPE titration assays.   
\[...\]   
Ampligen used i.p. at **10 mg**/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure also **reduced virus lung titres to below detectable limits.**

2. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2787736/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2787736/)

&gt;We adapted and characterized a new strain of SARS-CoV (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5- to 6-week-old BALB/c mice.  
\[...\]  
In v2163-infected mice, **Ampligen‚Ñ¢ was fully protective**, stinging nettle lectin (UDA) was partially protective, ribavirin was disputable and possibly exacerbated disease, and [EP128533](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EP128533) was inactive.   
2. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod)  
&gt;  
&gt;It concluded that Ampligen has been **""generally well tolerated""**, with a ""low incidence of clinical toxicity"", particularly when compared with the toxicity of the diseases it is used to treat.   
\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;""**No serious safety issues have resulted from the administration of \~75,000 doses** IV (most commonly 400¬†mg) twice weekly for up to one year periods or greater.  
\[...\]

But trouble with the FDA back in the day..

&gt;Hemispherx filed a [New Drug Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Drug_Application) (NDA) with the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)) (FDA) to market and sell rintatolimod for the treatment of CFS,[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod#cite_note-Hemispherx2007NDA-5) but this was **rejected in December 2009**, because the FDA concluded that the two [RCTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) ""did not provide credible evidence of efficacy""[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod#cite_note-PBJ2010-02-12-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod#cite_note-thestreet_dec09-7) and ""because of **clinical, statistical, clinical pharmacology, nonclinical, product quality, and facilities inspection deficiencies**.""[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod#cite_note-fda1-8) 

Yet then yesterday, some good news that shot it to the mooooon  
[https://aimimmuno.irpass.com/AIM-ImmunoTech-Announces-FDA-Authorization-for-First-Human-Ampligen-Trial-in-COVID-19-Patients-with-Cancer-Provides-Corporate-Business-Update-for-the-First-Quarter-of-2020](https://aimimmuno.irpass.com/AIM-ImmunoTech-Announces-FDA-Authorization-for-First-Human-Ampligen-Trial-in-COVID-19-Patients-with-Cancer-Provides-Corporate-Business-Update-for-the-First-Quarter-of-2020)

&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration has **authorized the first human trial** assessing the safety and effectiveness of the Company's lead asset, Ampligen (rintatolimod), in combination with interferon alfa-2b, in cancer patients with COVID-19  
\[...\]  
A comparison of important pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) indicated that **both viruses utilized the same ACE2 receptor to bind to and infect human cells.**   
\[...\]  
Ellen Lintal, CFO of AIM ImmunoTech, stated, ""I am pleased to report we have a solid balance sheet with **over $31.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2020.**   
\[...\]  
**Net loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 was $3.8 million,** or $0.22 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or $2.91 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019.

At this rate, you're looking at 3 year runway?  


Product isn't really meant for COVID-19, they've been doing trials for a lot of other issues. But reopening the SARS studies and jumping straight into human trials with something that was 100% effective in one researcher-generated strain of SARS

Know this is penny sub, but feeling bullish on this.

   
**Why?**

  
Yesterday looking at resistance around 3.45 at the start with firm support at 3, but then as the day went on and people kept shorting, the resistance moved to 3.10 and now 3 but each time it tries going back to the day before's resistance level - yet can't. Hmm... bullish?  


**Trading**

At the technical level, this is a penny stock to day trade on the caterpillar pattern if it keeps that up - good 20 cent scalps each time, but if you're swing trading, think about hanging long - at the fundamental level, this is looking bullish over a week period with results from either Japan or the FDA trial Phase 1 to come out in a few weeks time and shake this up.

**Too early?** Maybe. 

But nice time to get in if you think the fundamentals of the drug will show positive news over the hurdle of having to deal with the strains (heard something like 14 strains of COVID-19 already?)

If it's anything like the animal study, this would go to the mooooooon. But likewise, a risk to drop back to pre-feb levels.

Hope this help some of you make decisions on AIM. Playing with this a bit, the risk/reward ratio seems nice"	Ampligen (AIM) - bullish?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk3gax/ampligen_aim_bullish/

Kyletrammell	1589520670	"I am somewhat new here, as are many of you. As we all have come to notice, penny stocks are EXTREMELY volatile.

You don't just make all your money overnight, and if you do, greed will come back to kick you in the ass. Many of us, including myself, have experienced that. If that weren't the case, Warren Buffet would be putting all of his money into penny stocks like some of us here do. It's an investment... this whole process takes time.

My point is that gains are gains. Maybe sometimes you'll have a 75% return on a trade, sometimes it will be 1%, sometimes it will be a negative return. 

What I have attached are multiple spreadsheets showing how much weekly returns can add up over 3 years **with a $500 starting investment**. From a weekly return of 1% up to 15%.

Again as I said I am somewhat new and I am **learning** with you all. We are in this together, this is just something you should keep in the back of your mind. 

THIS DOES NOT MEAN SELL EVERY STOCK AT A MINIMAL RETURN. Have confidence in what you invest in... if you don't have confidence in your investments then you should probably not be investing in it.

**Something to note**\- I'm not excellent with excel so in the B column you'll notice I did 1.01 representing a 1% gain for that week or 1.02 representing a 2% gain for that week... etc. I also apologize that the numbers are small and hard to read.

I don't post a lot on this since I am new, so feel free to constructively criticize. Thanks and good luck fellas.

handsofhope	1589491925	"AIM had a huge spike with the FDA approval for human trials with Ampligen. I‚Äôve noticed a higher support around 2.60 -2.75 after the news hit, although it may be a bit of a barrier at the $3 mark for the time being.

Given the strong ties to SARS and the usage of Ampligen in 2003, along with the go for trials, I expect this to reach $3.50 when news of trials actually happening are underway for fighting COVID-19, and then a strong pump before the results are released. If trials were a success, then it will skyrocket. If not, I hope you all sold before the news like we‚Äôre all supposed to but never do.

I‚Äôm in at $2.95, so I got in a bit too high, but I plan to hold throughout the research process or until I profit 15% @3.40. I just wanted to hear your insights. Best of luck lads and ladettes"	Thoughts on AIM?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjvkka/thoughts_on_aim/

* Latest studies from the US Army Corps of Engineers show the mine will do no harm to environment
* **The proposed mining site is believed to be the world's largest undeveloped source for copper and gold along with many other sought after minerals/metals**:  [https://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/pebble-project/project-overview/](https://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/pebble-project/project-overview/)
* NAK received favorable court ruling on opponents accusations
* Alaska's economy is hurting due to low oil demand, this is opening people's minds to other natural resource income
* NAK's mine will provide thousands of jobs, at least 1,000 of which will pay over $100,000/yr
* The Permanent Fund will increase significantly (this is the payment that each Alaska resident gets each year from natural resources).  The fund has already taken a hit over the years since it's dependent mainly on oil

They also just completed a new stock offering and raised C$17 million

Cicero1982	1589477438	"I will be making a more detailed tutorial on how to do micro-cap DD on a risk based model but there‚Äôs something I consider more urgent; particularly for new investors. NEVER INVEST IN A PENNY STOCK UNLESS YOU KNOW THE FOLLOWING!

1. How long can they operate until they need to raise money? They will generally tell you how long they expect current operations to last at current levels on their 10-K‚Äôs, 10-Q‚Äôs, and DEF -14A‚Äôs. Find the last one and look for how long they expect to operate at current funding levels. Then estimate when they will raise money again. This will prevent bag holding due to offerings. REMEMBER! Just because they expect to operate at current funding levels until Q-1 2020 DOES NOT MEAN they will wait until that date to raise money! You can also estimate their current financial standing by reviewing their last 10k/10Q or DEF-14A and reviewing the offerings since that time. Should give you a good idea. Previous offerings can be reviewed in 8K‚Äôs.

2. Are there outstanding warrants? Check out their warrant history to see how many they issued, at what strike price, and how many were exercised. The left over warrants are a risk. If they are exercised you will experience a dramatic drop in security value. You can usually look for previous warrants both sold and exercised by sorting through their 8K‚Äôs. They are generally sold with public/private offerings. Researching this will prevent you from bag-holding due to the exercise of warrants. 

3. When must they be back in NASDAQ compliance? If out of compliance they face either delisting or a reverse split. No one will want to be around for either of those. You can find their drop dead compliance date on their DEF 14-A‚Äôs and sometimes in other forms. 8-K's usually announce delisting notices. If there is a shareholder meeting between now and the compliance date, there is usually a vote on the R/S. If that is the case you know you are at least safe until the shareholder meeting. If that is not the case you must attempt to estimate if they plan a R/S in the immediate future. This will prevent you from bag-holding on a surprise R/S. Remember they need to be above $1.00 for 10 days to a month (depending on the circumstance) to regain compliance. 

4. What are their expected catalysts? What good news are you expecting and when will it explode? This will help you get in before the pop. You can estimate this by reviewing their last PR 8K‚Äôs, and their last 10-K‚Äôs or 10-Q. You can get some good ideas by asking folks in forums with some business sense. 

5. Are institutions increasing their investment or decreasing their investment in the penny stock? This one is obvious. Simply type the ticker into google next to the words ‚Äúinstitutional investors.‚Äù

6. Are insiders buying or selling? Are they doing anything? Another obvious one. You can find total insider shares on the most recent DEF-14A. You need to ensure that the folks owning the company are buying more shares each year. If not there is likely a reason. You will also want to know how much of a stake insiders have in their own company. A CEO who owns but a few shares (relatively speaking) is likely holding out for better times. You can find insider buying simply by looking for their Form 4‚Äôs. 

7. You‚Äôre going to want to know the short volume, the short interest, and the naked short interest. Shorting presents both opportunities and risks for longs. Plenty of references on that in the link below.

There are a number of considerations for investing in pennies. At minimum you should know the above questions. [All of them can be answered using these tools](https://www.tradinganalysisresources.com/2020/05/free-references-and-resources.html?m=1)

Full transparency- Fwiw - I‚Äôm new to it... got in yesterday &amp; more today...... now watching closely and feeling confident. Haven‚Äôt been able to access the CC notes yet. Was going to post this in Daily Discussion but it got a little large.... 

Little Quicknotes snapshot here and my opinions for why I am sticking around...

-US-Based Manufacturer completing deals for the military during a very difficult &amp; ‚Äúnationalist‚Äù time ...

-Improved EBITDA , still negative but with backlog of orders totalling over $13.3million SO FAR it is obvious IMO that next EBITDA improves markedly

-Improved first quarter year-over-year growth (usually sucks first Q as stated)

-‚ÄúTier 1‚Äù customer still being discussed which bumped up revenues in Q1

-‚Äúreduction in non-cash stock compensation for the board of directors... ‚Äú = a responsible move by management during this time

-IMO : responsible use of an ATM (at-the-market offering) during the quarter... Where just $1.5million in stock issued and sold ‚Äî- NOT a big deal and explains the shares we see hitting the float. (Look up the difference between an ATM offering &amp; convertible debt if you don‚Äôt know as this is ‚Äúat the market‚Äù and so it‚Äôs way less damaging than notes...)

This is good for short, mid, and long term hold. I‚Äôm not going to go too deep in it as it is best to do your own DD and analysis. However, this is a great buy especially at .7 right now (9:24 AM MST).  It is also worth mentioning that In AH it went up to a .79-.8. I also linked below my chart analysis on its dips and uptrend (my reddit post yesterday).

Companies past: 
	Before the first half of of 2019 this stock was over 5.31. After a reverse split stock the shares were worth a high of 3.36 and a low of 1.46. As the news of Coronavirus hit their stock feel off very quickly dropping from 2.06 to .91 in a week. They continued to fall to their 52w low, .28 (wish I found this stock then). Overtime they have just bend gradually raising from .39 to it‚Äôs current .7 in a month without any big hype around it. 
	As for the company, they sold their patent for its spine silicone nitride in 2018 on a 10 year deal. 
Companies future: 
	Because of their past and the charts, it is easy to confidently say this company will continue to rise into at least the low ones in the upcoming months. They are currently looking for a way to use their technology in the COVID-19 scenario with rumored to be specialized mask. With the selling go their ‚Äúhighly successful‚Äù spinal implant, they were able to turn their attention to other means and are experimenting with their silicone nitrate solutions in many different areas such as technology as well. To add onto this, they claim to be one of a kind in their field cause they are the only people that are using silicone nitrate in used in such ways as themselves. 
	The company also has a high motivation to release PR soon and has said so themselves that they are determined to reach NASDAQ compliance again. 

Consensus: Short term: I am up 13% in less than a week. The company will continue to rise over time and with gained attention that exposure will be faster (target range 1.2++)
Mid term: It‚Äôll still raise as PRs get announced and more news is released (target 1.8++)
Long term: This company is one major advancement away from being a standing company worth a lot more than just .7. With their technology they can very well change the way implants are done and how they perform, as well as them expanding their fields into other areas of the world such as aerospace, electronics, and many more.

lambogainz	1590195738	"The offering price change news came out at 3pm est. Prices continued to increase to the daily high after that - around 3:25, which suggests that the market reacted favorably to the news. It wasn't until a few minutes before closing that the selling and price fall occurred - most likely around the time of the first Reddit post about it which confused people. If this was bad news, like an actual offering, prices would've fallen right away - see nndm and cidm as examples this week of prices falling as soon as news of an offering is released

The amended offering is higher and over a wider range than the previous one, which is GOOD news. Especially when the stock is on the rise. Yes, .05 is low, but that does not mean it will actually go that low. I see this slightly dipping Tuesday, and then more people buying in, and it‚Äôs up from there

With a solid product and news coming, this will hit at minimum .40 by the end of next week.

They also own five airports, bus terminals, toll bridges/ tunnels, a train?, and the third largest port in America.

Then social media starts saying ""volume precedes price, selling on low volume"". That doesn't really mean anything. If a stock went +50% on heavy volume then afterwards goes -50% on low volume, you still lose all gains and become a bagholder, really don't care if it's high or low volume when stock goes down you lose and are stuck"	"""volume precedes price"" - stupidest thing ever?"	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/goquf3/volume_precedes_price_stupidest_thing_ever/

Here is what I have

MARK - was going to sell but this thing is 1 PR away from skyrocketing

RMED - closed their offering today should move nicely into next week

XELA - Awaiting official PR on the Fintech announcement from the CEO

NTEC - beat earning expectations and it did not move - not really sure what is going on here

Stanthetradingman does so much day trading he can be a bit hard to trust for swings, and he expects his followers to figure all DD out for themselves. BSS makes a lot of good calls but also makes a lot of stagnant or bad calls, and a lot you have to wait on forever. He is also quite arrogant and had the SEC filling for being paid to pump. From my experience however, Alex seems rather transparent, honest, and very willing to share DD on really good picks.

[u/TheBazaarTrades](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheBazaarTrades/) alerted to TOPS for short to mid.

China has announced a $667B stimulus that need to be divvied out by local governments.

‚ÄúWith more infrastructure projects, I think **it will eventually drive up commodity and shipping demand**, however, we still need to see how will the local governments allocate these funds as so far there aren‚Äôt any clear guidance issued by the central government on the matter yet,‚Äù said Lin Ziyu, an analyst from Citic Securities."	$TOPS - $667B Stimulus plan	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/golfjg/tops_667b_stimulus_plan/

FernandoCastle	1590159432	"I'm pretty new to this and couldn't figure out how to get news of a stock I see potential in dropping without watching all day, so I could buy loads of it and ride for a week. My fix to that is to buy single shares of the ones I think may drop then take off even if its only a few percent. When I do that robin hood updates me on whether it goes up or down. For example I bought a single share of GNC about 2 maybe 3 weeks ago at .52 I got a notification that it was down to .39 so I got on and checked.... it was at .40 so I bought about 2k shares. The next week it was up to nearly .60 now I get thats not a huge jump but what works for me is finding quasi decent companies that are well known but are in the struggle atm and try and nab them when they're at their lowest hold for a day or two then jump ship even if its not maxed out yet.

Pros: 

Back to being undervalued

PB 0.02

Quiroga Moreno Isidoro insider has not been changed, still remains a buy

TOP SHIPS has received a consensus rating of Buy via score 3.00

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

Recent public direct offering (though not as bad direct offering)

Mixed sentiments from the community

Debt to asset is too high -70.00%

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions of the following I'll be answering:**

Are you going short or midshort? mid short

What's your entry suggestion? 0.14 or 0.13

What's the breakout line? 0.155

Safe entry/exits? 

Entry 0.142, safe exit 0.144

Do you think there will be another offer? Not for a while. Its consolidation is fully exhausted. 

How will this go tomorrow? The posting is meant for making a call-out for short/mid-term meaning this is a slow momentum waiting to happen (similar to XSPA).

Gankeshu	1590125052	" Just started getting into the penny stock game. So far it has been fun with some birds flying away from me like APDN. I like to research and I brought some Inpixion about 200 shares and made close to 30 bucks off it so far. Nothing big but I didn't put in much either. Looking at forecasts and reviews about this company it's all over the place. Crazy stock predictions like $12,000 to $1,000 in a year. Some places have them at 0 in a year. You look at their stats and they're not making much for their stocks to be valued at those 4 - 5 digit quotes. 

What's the real deal on this company? I've had luck with em so far I'm in the green. I was thinking about putting more in  and holding to see if they'd climb out of the penny stock range like some of my other investments did or if they're just buffoonery I'll sell and take my meager profits and put them into a more stable stock.  If it's too good to be true it is and don't put all your eggs in one basket is what I'm riding on. Lot of stocks are looking funky now but some showing promise as things pick up. I want to get in on the action while the poor can afford to get some decent stocks while the tide is low if you know what I mean. I just don't want the tide to be so low I end up getting beached."

Clinical Biopharm company focused on antibody radiation. They‚Äôve gone from .18 to .20 in the last 2 days. (Not much I know, but could possibly hint at a limited time boom or uptick). Here‚Äôs my very limited DD (if you could call it that) 

PR shows that: [here](https://m.marketscreener.com/ACTINIUM-PHARMACEUTICALS-16113719/)

-  they got an extension for their expense report due to small accounting dept. and Covid (now due 6/29)
- in April they sold almost 211 million common shares to the public; generating $31.6 million. They got contacted by the NYSE due to violating a rule of having consistent listings and lowered prices; which is now likely to lead to a reverse split,possibly no later than the end of October. Neglecting to effectuate the reverse split could lead to them being delisted. 

Doesn‚Äôt appear to be any insider trades, or any good news/breakthrough trials coming out. But it may be a possible P&amp;D or grab‚Äôn‚Äô snag before a reverse split or delisting.

A ""direct deposit"" technically means that they want you to deposit the money right from payroll, but you can actually meet this requirement simply by transferring in $200 from CASH APP! So you could deposit $200 into cash app, then withdraw that $200 into chime and get the $50 bonus!

If you don't have cash app, you can also transfer in $200 from the following banks to fulfill the same requirements- Ally, Charles Schwab, Chase, Circle Pay App, Discover, Hancock Whitney, Huntington, PNC, Serve, TD Bank, USAA, US Bank, Wells Fargo.

**Qapital:**

Qapital is a banking app that pays you a $20 bonus for making at least a $20 deposit from any source. You need to set up a savings goal and a rule to automatically transfer funds to Qapital (One easy option would be to set up a $5 weekly transfer so that you can quickly qualify for the bonus). They have a monthly fee (Qapital Basic is $3/month; Qapital Complete is $6/month; and Qapital Master is $12/month.) which is waived for the first month.

If you keep your account open for 45 days, maintain a $20 account balance, and make 1 membership payment, they will credit you with a $20 account bonus. You can then immediately close the account and take your deposit + the bonus out with no additional charges.

it is no a coincidence that institutional ownership is at an all time high THIS year.

NT219, which is developed by its majority-owned subsidiary, TyrNovo Ltd., is a novel patented small molecule designed to overcome cancer drug resistance that is currently in pre-clinical development.

\-Antibe is a biomedical firm in Toronto which has developed a drug to treat arthritic pain.

\-The drug is more precise in its delivery method than established athritic and pain relief

\-Preliminary / P1-P2 data has been promising

\-Phase 2b Data release is imminent, likely within the coming trading week, having been previously delayed by the chaos created by COVID-19

\-Yahoo User ""Mr. Murdock"" emailed the CEO to ask if they would uplist to create US trading volume, who responded: *""having established one of the most liquid securities on the TSXV, we share your desire to see our US presence and trading volumes grow -- and we are methodically working towards this goal. Foremost, we see the upcoming release of Phase 2 top-line data as a key stepping stone on that path.""* Considering they already have access to the data, this could mean they are confident that it will be well received and raise the price.

‚ÄúAll Revenues from the first two acquisitions will be consolidated and included in our Q2 financial due on June 30th.‚Äù

Bogashi	1590759469	"Here are some reasons to buy GNUS

Offerings:

- Offering at $0.35, the price spiked up

- Offering at $1.25, the price spiked up

- New offering announced on the 28th at $1.50, very likely for price to spike up, offering is on June 1st

https://ir.gnusbrands.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001683168-20-001765/genius_8k.htm?TB_iframe=true&amp;height=auto&amp;width=auto&amp;preload=false

The new offering will bring $30 million in gross proceeds which is a ton considering that the company only makes about $5 million a year

Yahoo Finance has identified both short and long term bullish patterns, there is a bullish pattern that is starting to grow as the offering day is closer.


Earnings:

The earnings day is June 9th pre market which makes for lots of time for the stock to grow in anticipation of the earnings.

- The stock has very low debt which adds value to the stock and company

- GNUS has a low float of around 45 million shares which makes the stock easier to push up and increase the price around earnings


TV Channel Merger:

GNUS has announced that it will be merging its 2 TV channels into one which will be called the Kartoon Channel. This channel will greatly expand the reach and distribution of the companies content. 

Currently, their reach is about 100 million on TVs and 200 million on other devices, especially now, with everyone being home, their reach will expand massively.

They recently acquired 3000 episodes of content that will be streamed over their new channel which will further increase their channels viewers.

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/06/2028502/0/en/Genius-Brands-International-to-Launch-Kartoon-Channel-Digital-Network-Across-Amazon-Prime-Apple-TV-Comcast-Cox-SelectTV-DISH-Sling-TV-Tubi-Xumo-and-More.html

Amazon will start streaming Kartoon Channel content on June 15th


GNUS has a lot of potentials and is, at this moment, a good short and long term hold.

With all the recent positive news about the company, the price is expected to rise up until earnings which is on June 9th pre market.

Kommanderdude	1590759002	"How much do you typically make in a year from trading? I‚Äôd love to be able to transition to trading full time on the next 3 years and quite my job doing trade work.

For me it‚Äôs less about the money and more about the flexibility and being able to do what I want on a given day. Even if I was only making my current salary( between 50-60k depending on OT, I‚Äôd be happy. How long did it take you to transition to full time trading? What things did you learn that would have made it easier for you in the beginning?  How much money would you need in your trading account to make 60k a year? How much for 100k? I‚Äôm sure it varies but a rough idea would be great. Any learning resources you would recommend?

FEEL_THE_BAYERN	1590750505	"I said I would post this yesterday and then I got distracted by various social obligations so here we are! 

$INQD (Indoor Harvest Corp) is a contractor for the vertical and indoor farming industry, i.e. they build weed farms. They do ALL the engineering, ALL the procurement, ALL the construction, etc. They offer so much different technology to customers for their farms, I‚Äôm not gonna list it all out here, it‚Äôll be in one of the links I provide. Enough about what the company is though, you want to know why it‚Äôll pop off.

Well, back on May 11th, we got confirmation that INQD will be starting a joint venture with a company called Fincann Corp in New York. Fincann is an investment bank that focuses specifically on weed related businesses, they also allow individual accounts to be opened with them. 


https://fincann.com

Along with this joint venture, comes the appointment of a new CEO, Leslie Bocskor. Leslie is a well recognized consultant in the weed industry, and has been featured in Forbes, CNBC, and WSJ. He formed Electrum Partners in 2014 and then became the founding chairman of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association. He knows a lot of about weed, what the market wants, and has stated on a few occasions that he plans to flip the company around, and I believe he absolutely will do it with the help of Fincaan.

Their 8-K comes out at the end of June and with it will likely come much greater news about the joint venture and their ever increasing financial position. I believe we will see this steadily increase throughout June, to maybe TLSS levels due to hype and the fact that a genuinely good business plan is being laid out by a good company.

Like I always say, it‚Äôs cheap, not a lot of room to go down, it had 160 million in volume yesterday and has increased every day this week, up from .001 to .006 in one week, and it‚Äôs only going to keep going up. 

Once again, I do have a vested interest in this stock, I am holding 200k shares at .005, make sure you do your own research, and good luck today!

Cinizzz	1590742579	"Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I got inspired by a recent initiative in this sub where someone (sorry forgot the name) was doing an analysis of the number of mentions of stocks. So I expanded upon this idea, and created a small graph with the number of mentions everyday, and charting the top 10 mentions per day in a graph. This graph could be found here:  [http://pennystocks.eutravellers.com/](http://pennystocks.eutravellers.com/)  This graph is being updated automatically every night, to show the day's mentions. 

So far, it's just a very simple count of stock name mentioned in a post subject. My aim is to continue to improve upon this by adding number of DD (with a link to them), and maybe also include posts which got awards (platinum/gold/silver) to give a rise to high quality content. 

I'd appreciate if you could take look, and provide me with some feedback (good or bad, I don't mind). My aim with this project is to get a better understanding of stocks which are being pumped, hopefully being able to get in, make some money and get out, so at least I would be able to pay for the hosting üòÇ  

Either way, this is just a side project for me, and to be honest I can't really dedicate a lot of hours on it right now. But I'm hoping to one day be able to base my decisions on this one, saving me a lot of hours of research and DDs."

This may be a very stupid question newb question, however, I would really appreciate if somebody could point me in the right direction‚Ä¶ I have tried to look into finding the answer for myself but was overwhelmed with info.

I am UK based and would like to invest a couple of hundred pounds into TLSS, although, frankly I am not sure on how to do so as previously I have only ever used the app ‚Äò‚ÄôFreetrade‚Äô‚Äô to buy stocks and TSS is not on there. Freetrade set me up with an investment ISA in last year‚Äôs tax year.

Am I right in thinking that I will need to open an account with a shares broker to do so? I tried looking into IG yesterday but couldn‚Äôt confirm if I could actually buy TLSS stock or not through it before signing up so I left it and hoped to ask you guys.

If I do need to open an account with a shares broker will that mean I will have another ISA with them and if so will that cause any implications with my Freetrade ISA. Any recommendations would be greatly received.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Kyletrammell	1590731993	"For those of you who don't know how to read these charts I will explain. I will also explain why I like NOVN and expect a spike soon.

https://preview.redd.it/br3062go2n151.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a195fd9d69b9e0f9c929949fa35a167a767c56ec

So this is the daily chart for the last year for NOVN. What you need to look at are the SMA's. SMA stands for Simple Moving Average which isn't more than an average price over a given time period. In this case there are SMA 50, 200, and 20 day lines.

When a stock has been on a major decline, which essentially all penny stocks are, the short term SMA can cross a longer above a term SMA which will very commonly lead to a spike. It is also known as a golden cross, an incredibly bullish pattern.

For example look in December. The SMA 20 (light purple line) crossed above the SMA 50 (darker orange line) and you can see how much the price jumped.

**Why there wasn't a spike in September when they crossed:**

Novan was awarded a **1.1 million dollar grant from the department of defense**, which kind of came out of nowhere, so there wasn't exactly a consolidation phase. The price jumped before the stock evened out which is the consolidation phase. Below is the link.

 [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/20/1918518/0/en/Novan-Awarded-Approximately-1-1-Million-Grant-by-Department-of-Defense.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/20/1918518/0/en/Novan-Awarded-Approximately-1-1-Million-Grant-by-Department-of-Defense.html) 

https://preview.redd.it/qo1h7r7q2n151.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc0d4d093f9b7f37e70c27b5e747708f9e4eb63e

**Here's why I think it will spike:**

This stock has held it's position of around 40 cents incredibly strong for a while now. If that SMA 20 can cross over the SMA 50, this will very likely spike for reasons I explained above in terms of the chart. 

In terms of the company, they have formulated a plan for covid-19. Link below to the whole presentation:

 [https://novan.gcs-web.com/static-files/9ca720e1-7cdb-4904-aa92-9c37c5388cb1](https://novan.gcs-web.com/static-files/9ca720e1-7cdb-4904-aa92-9c37c5388cb1)

What you need to know from that slide are really two things. One- Nitric Oxide has the ability to stop reproduction of viruses in the Coronavirus sector. Novan has great technology for NO. Two- the company is also looking for grants. That is exactly what happened in September and you can see how much they spiked when that happened."

_Pone	1590727802	"[u/JohnLouis24](https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnLouis24/) recently made a post on this stock which I'm going to link right [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/grymzo/cdbb/) After seeing it I decided to do some of my own research and post it. Let me know what you all think.

John's post details that CBDD has made some acquisitions, whose earnings should show up on CBDD q2 on June 30th. 

 

The main products for CBDD are:

* CBD social network: a forum for cbd education
* Black  Pearl: brand of CBD non thc hemp products. (Like if you were trying to  upsell weed to white people, this is how you would do it. Not a bad  thing, just my interpretation)
* And finally the two recent Swiss acquisitions,  I‚ÄôM Canabiz AG and  Royal Green GmbH  

   * One  of those companies is I‚ÄôM Canabiz AG, after being acquired changed its  name to Swiss Industry Ventures AG. As a quick note this is actually a [reverse merger](https://cbdofdenver.com/2020/04/06/cbd-of-denver-inc-cbdd-corporate-updates-3/)  not an acquisition, doesn't really effect the bottom line, but I think  its important to understand what this company is trying to do. Also they  mention that through the merger they were able to shed toxic debt,  though they don't mention how

&amp;#x200B;

What its trying to do with them:

* Essentially  they want to become a leader in the Swiss market due to its new semi  legalization and to do so by acquiring and growing small companies with  1-5 mil in revenue and sourcing product cheaply from the US. Swiss is  the focus, but they are starting the process of moving into other areas  of Europe.
* Just  to be clear CBD and THC are different, CBD is legal in Switzerland  while THC is not. All acquisition have been focused on CDB, but when THC  eventually becomes legal, obviously this companies will be in a good  position to take advantage
* They  are planning to purchase CBD Welt 24, which is a profitable company  with 2 growing facilities earning 800-1200k per year, by the end of May  though that time frame is unlikely. They are also working with 3 other  acquisition targets.

&amp;#x200B;

Finances:

* CBDD  has published no financial data and information from yahoo,  marketwatch, and etraed doesn't add up. For example etrade says there  are **4 billion shares outstanding** with a **market cap of 5.1 million.** While marketwatch says **340K market cap** which is about **220 million shares outstanding**. 
* I'm Canabiz AG year 2019 data can be found [here](https://investors.imcannabis.com/#overview): (Data in Thousands of Canadian Dollars)
   * (2019 / 2018)
   * Current ratio: 6.45 / 4.43    
   * Revenue: 9074 / 5197
   * NI: (7129) / 2715
   * EPS: (.06) / .02
   * No debt, 11.8 Mil in Cash
   * After reading their cash flow statements a large portion of their  unprofitability in 2019 stems from changes in CBD price and increase in receivables which is a short term drain on cash
   * Strategic Development in 2019
      * Created a subsidiary in Portugal aimed at obtaining a license to cultivate medical cannabis
      * Acquired Adjupharm, a German licensed medical cannabis company
      * Entered  into supply agreement with an international pharmaceutical company  based in Spain which specializes in narcotics and active pharmaceutical  ingredients
      * **Important:**  Their 2020 investor presentation focuses mostly on Germany, but CBDD's  press release is talking mostly about Swiss, weird? Maybe the swiss  market is some sort of recent pivot and they haven't updated their  presentation?
* Royal Green GmbH: All I could find is this [press release](https://cbdofdenver.com/2020/05/18/cbd-of-denver-inc-cbdd-signs-agreement-to-acquire-2nd-swiss-company/) stating that they make 600-700k. I would assume its annual, but there was no specification.

&amp;#x200B;

Other

* Swiss Industry Venture's (SIV) long term planing to become a fully reporting company
* CBDD just update some of their Chief positions including the CEO, all of whom seem solid

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

"" [The](https://cbdofdenver.com/2020/05/18/cbd-of-denver-inc-cbdd-signs-agreement-to-acquire-2nd-swiss-company/)  Revenues from the first two acquisitions will be consolidated and  included in our Q2 financial filing due on June 30th. "" So both Royal  and Canabiz would be reported on June 30. Now earnings are probably  still going to be negative but, revenue should be much higher. If the  market cap is 340k, this is incredible news, if its 5.1 million, less  so. Exactly 15 times less incredible, and I'm focusing on market cap  because its essentially what the company is worth. With no clear past  financial data its hard to say whether this is a good buy, I mean with  these mergers it might now be worth the 5.1 million valuation if that's  actually its market cap. In the long term this company looks fine,  though this is a penny stock and the short term is more important.  Having said that I doubt they would be releasing a financial report in who knows how long if it was shit, so there's that. I've sent them an  email regarding the shares outstanding and I'll update if i get a response, I'll also probably yolo some money into this regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not financial advice and as of posting I have no stake in this company.

NoahW23	1590726787	"Hey everyone, I am 18 years old and given the current state of the world along with my newfound ability to do so, I have gotten into trading! Trading/learning to invest is surely a skill that I hope will pay dividends (see what I did!) in the future, so now I believe is the best time to get into it (also considering how volatile the market is), as I can comfortably invest with little to no risk. 

I started out with a deposit of 450 dollars (so naturally, I invest in penny stocks) knowing that any loss would be insignificant. However, while yes, I have invested a little amount of money, I try to think of that money as if it were a large amount. I do get upset when I lose money, even though it is typically a loss of only a few dollars, because when I start making an income, I do hope to invest and I will put more than 450 dollars in. 

Lately, it has been more losses than gains, and I am upset with myself. I began trading two months ago with said 450 dollars, and at the time of me writing this, I am sitting at an unfortunate 282 dollars. It sucks. I understand that a loss of 168 dollars is insignificant, and it is, but that is an approximate 37 percent loss. A 37 percent loss is a significant one and had I invested more money, the consequences of that loss would not be fun. Also, seeing red is discouraging! But like I said, now is the time to learn. Better I lose now than later in life. 

Here are my greatest losses for the most part:

$RTTR - I lost about 30 bucks. I held through a call which announced if I remember correctly a merger but then an r/s? I forget to be completely honest. Anyway, I believe I held too long. 

$MVIS - Bought the rumor, didn't sell the news. I bought MVIS at the climax of this Reddit's infatuation with it, and if I remember correctly, I had a chance to make a decent (it's all relative) profit. I held too long and sold for a 30 dollar loss. Part of me still really believes in MVIS and I do think their tech is too valuable not to be bought out, so I bought back in and am currently down 10 dollars. I kind of want to just be done with MVIS and invest in other places, but you don't lose until you sell. I might just stick with it. 

$DCAR - This one really upsets me. I invested in DCAR at 1.29 and then averaged down to 1.24 after it dipped a bit. As of right now, I've lost about 45 dollars. Everyone knew that a merger was coming so the stock was rising. I bought in thinking it would continue to go up, and then right when I got in, it started tanking. When the merger was formally announced today it went up to around 1.15 I believe. I had a chance to get my losses down to about 8 dollars, but instead, I held. It tanked super fast and I am down as I said 45 dollars. 

There are plenty more small losses and small gains along the way too, but I have yet to have any massive (once again, it's all relative, a massive gain to me would be like 20 bucks lol) gains. I always feel I get in too late. 

Here is what I have learned in my limited experience (I just have to actually apply it!):

\- Sell at any profit. If I had just sold some of the aforementioned stocks at any point above my entry point, I WOULD HAVE MADE MONEY. I would like to say that I will start doing this, but man it is easier said than done. 

\- Don't chase. I feel like I have been pretty decent at this, but still, if you look at this list of my greatest losses, they were all pretty hyped up stocks. I have definety got in too late quite a few times. 

What I have yet to learn:

\- I need to be a swing trader. I only get three day trades a week and use Robinhood (it's new-trader friendly! I know the hours suck!). I guess I definitely need to learn what stocks are day-trade worthy, as I do not want to be in a situation where I could have made a lot of money but could not due to the day trade limit. 

\- Also, options...I don't think I can really use them due to how little money I have put into stocks, but I want to learn how they work. I get the general concept- you're betting on the stock rising or falling. However, I know that there is so much more to it.

\- I feel like the main reason for my lack of gains is due to me getting in too late. Sure, there will be cases where a stock will be up, say, 20 percent and I get in and the stock goes up to something like 23 percent, but I have yet to invest in a stock where I enter maybe when it's red, or something like that, and it goes up like 40 percent. Anyway, my point is I have never been in a stock for the ""whole ride."" 

\- \^ I feel like this is due to the fact that I rely on others largely for my stock investment ideas. I have followed many successful traders on Twitter and StockTwits, and largely invest off their ""alerts."" I mean, I'm new, I feel like many new and not new traders do this. As you can see, whether it's due to me getting in too late or me making stupid decisions, I really have not been successful doing that. I need to learn how to do my own DD, as I believe that is how I can start to make more gains. If I research a stock and decide to invest and it increases, I make gains. Well duh, but If I have to wait for an alert before I get in, and by that time, the stock has been pumped and more people have caught on, then if anything, my gains will be minimal and people will begin to sell-off. How do I do this? I read news, I read PR releases, I know what companies I deem ""promising,"" but what should I be looking for? I know earnings per share is good, but by the time those are released, the stock is either way up or down. Increased volume? If other people are buying it, it must be for a reason. I really need help on this!

Anyway, if you've read this far, thanks. I know that it might not be ""wise"" to get advice from a subreddit, but I have lurked here for a long time, I just don't feel confident enough to contribute yet. Anyway, if you're here, you have more experience than me and I really appricate you reading and hopefully commenting to help me out! 

Once again, thanks for reading and here is to gains in the future (hopefully)!"	Best Tips for a New Trader? (Please read this, I am 18 and eager to learn!)	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gsm0q1/best_tips_for_a_new_trader_please_read_this_i_am/

***Electra Meccanica -*** [https://electrameccanica.com/](https://electrameccanica.com/)

They are a Canadian manufacturer of fully electric vehicles that was established in 2015. They have always been a pre production company, that is until later this year. They are expected to release their first vehicle, the Solo.

***Solo -***

The Solo is a single person, three-wheeled, fully electric vehicle that you can reserve for purchase online now. Perfect for daily commuters that don't have a long drive, and for those that want a cheaper than average electric vehicle. I personally believe that it will go beyond appealing to regular consumers; It is perfect for businesses/warehouses that already use vehicles to get around. It would also be great for 3rd party food delivery service drivers, if there are enough chargers around. Key specs/details include;

* Battery has 100 mile range
* 0-60 in 10 seconds, top speed 80 mph
* Compatible with universal charging stations
* Comfortable and convenient interior features
* MSRP $18,500

Key Takeaways -

* Made continued progress toward production launch of the Company‚Äôs flagship ***SOLO***¬†EV, with a planned strategic debut in the Los Angeles market in the coming months followed by rollouts in other west coast cities later in 2020.
* After engaging BDO USA‚Äôs Site Selection &amp; Business Incentives Practice to lead a search for an assembly facility and engineering technical center in the U.S., the Company identified seven states as finalists and has sent initial requests for proposals to the chief economic development entities in each of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The leading location and backup sites are expected to be announced in the fourth quarter of 2020.
* Began development of new ***SOLO*** mobile app, available for both iOS and Android, which will provide owners with a connected vehicle experience, including various remote vehicle monitoring capabilities.
* Company was not affected by COVID-19

Key Takeaways (Not already mentioned) -

* Opened first retail kiosk at the Westfield Century City Shopping Mall in Los Angeles, providing customers with the opportunity to view, test drive and place pre-orders in a modern sleek storefront. ElectraMeccanica will open additional kiosks throughout 2020 in Southern California locations, as well as in the San Francisco area, Washington and Oregon.
* Entered into an agreement with FreedomRoad Financial, a national lending institution providing retail vehicle loans to the nation‚Äôs leading vehicle manufacturers, to provide consumers with turnkey vehicle financing solutions for the Company‚Äôs flagship ***SOLO*** EV.

***Final Note -***

Even if this car is not something you would drive I am confident there is a lot of people who would. It is too appealing for a number of reasons. Also keep in mind this is not the only vehicle they are designing; the Solo is just the first launch. They are also working on a sports class electric vehicle (Called *Tofino)* and an oldies luxury one as well (Called eRoadster).

**COVID-19**

According to CEO Shachar Daniel:

""Organizations have gained important insights in the struggle with COVID-19 and are now highly aware of the need to be prepared and equipped with a safe and scalable remote access solution to their resources in order to reduce downtime of their businesses to minimal.""

**Summary**

Safe-T is a reputable company that offers legitimate technology protection services. Their Q1 Results report *tremendous* growth from Q1 of last year, and now free of debenture debt, I predict that the the company will continue to grow throughout the year. SFET is currently sitting at a price of $1.35/share, and is a good bargain buy for a longer-term hold."

Couldn't sleep so was thinking about the S-3 shelving situation in regards to IBIO. The SEC document states that the document was filed Thursday (27th), and effective Friday (28th). I am ignorant as to the notice and disclosure rules of the Securities Act in regards to any advance notice necessary for the offering of shares on the market. Is it possible that the dip from the spike of 3.4 to 1.58 on the 28th be potentially caused by the release of said $100m in Securities?

[https://ceo.ca/@nasdaq/lexagenes-lx-analyzer-successfully-detects-coronavirus](https://ceo.ca/@nasdaq/lexagenes-lx-analyzer-successfully-detects-coronavirus) 

Dr. Jack Regan, LexaGene‚Äôs CEO and founder, says the company‚Äôs genetic analyzer can detect new pathogens such as the coronavirus in ‚Äújust one hour, on-site‚Äù.

‚ÄúCurrently the traditional process requires that samples from sick individuals must be transported to laboratories for manual processing,‚Äù Regan said. ‚ÄúThis is extremely inefficient and introduces a significant time-delay that can have severe consequences for disease spread. Today‚Äôs coronavirus outbreak highlights why LexaGene‚Äôs technology is needed so desperately.‚Äù

‚ÄúCurrently, no technology exists that allows for these locations to readily start screening for a new threat within days of an outbreak being identified,‚Äù Regan continued. **‚ÄúLexaGene is addressing this urgent problem and has developed the first ever, easy-to-use, open-access diagnostic analyzer that is designed to help control the spread of deadly outbreaks such as this 2019 coronavirus.‚Äù**

‚ÄúWith a traditional reference lab, by the time a clinic takes a sample and ships it off, you‚Äôve lost 12 to 24 hours,‚Äù said Dr. Jack Regan, the chief executive of LexaGene, a Massachusetts company that hopes to sell its coffee maker-size instrument to airports, schools and clinics. ‚ÄúWe can get results in under an hour, which makes a huge difference during deadly outbreaks.‚Äù 

"" A wider rollout of these tests faces a number of hurdles. Most of the tests identify a patient‚Äôs infection 80 to 90 percent of the time ‚Äî regulators would like that figure to be closer to 100 percent ‚Äî and many of them are still awaiting a green light from the F.D.A. But health experts say a larger impediment to their widespread use is economics: **Most of the tests run $500 to $3,000** (the test used to diagnose Mr. Springer was $2,000) and because few private insurances companies cover them, the costs are largely borne by hospitals or patients.

louied91	1585003415	"There was a comment on my post sharing the $ABMC news, along with a handful of PMs after the I responded back asking about [otcmethod.com](https://otcmethod.com), so I wanted to make a post about it. 

I had to go back and look, but I have been a member of OTCM since 2018. The majority of the questions were about if I thought it was worth it and what you get. The simple answer to it is that it is 100% worth it. 

I will put it this way. On my trade with $ABMC alone, my profits would cover 128 more months of otcmethod. That doesn't mean you are making that on every trade, but I know for myself I have easily covered the monthly fee and more and that is not including the knowledge and everything else you gain from the mentorship.

I feel like the website doesn't really do it justice as to how much work is actually put into this mentorship program. 

What you get:

* The essential videos to get you started 
* A video every weeknight recapping all the trades of the day and making watchlists
* A private discord for all members
   * Recap channel that alerts potential trades or if a stock is a bag
   * The owner/mentor, Pat, is always available for questions and to help
* The videos also have an audio-only version so you can listen to it from anywhere
* Some Teaching Articles Written periodically
* Modified KST for trading on 5 min / 30 min charts

There is plenty I am probably missing. But for anyone that is asking and was interested, there it is. I don't know if it will be for you, but I know for myself I couldn't have asked for a better program and the community is really the best. Everyone is friendly, willing to help, and it is just a fun environment."	I found $ABMC through otcmethod.com	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fntoir/i_found_abmc_through_otcmethodcom/

TheBazaarTrades	1584999695	"Hey, there gang. How's everyone? I hope everyone is crushing it and seeing the pattern for the supply/demand of pharm/bio stocks. We all know the deal here. There is a distinction between hype, profitable news, legitimate press release, earnings report, and procedure moving forward. I also want to include despite the differences between the good &amp; bad, anything can happen. Do charts still play a role? Absolutely. Can they still go in a bad direction? Of course. It all depends on what company ticker is a source and a necessity that could contribute to fighting against the Chinese Virus. 

Bellow, I introduce you to a potential diamond in the rough candidate: 

XSPA. 

Yes, I know what you're thinking. One, it's dirt cheap, two, it has a terrible recent EPS. While despite it has an awful EPS report, it still has other things we can appreciate great potential equivalent to the infamous BIOC that exploded recently (which in my BIOC is still a good candidate for all this bio/pharm demand).

&amp;#x200B;

Charting wise: It's a downtrend... however. 0.05 touch intrigued me, in a good way. You know me by now, I am fascinated by outside bar candles. Not only that, but it's also the lowest dip and maintained a well established HODL above the 0.10. For it to run into a bullish run or supernova intraday runner, it needs to break 0.18 &amp; higher, and further confirmation at 0.22. 

[XSPA chart](https://ibb.co/zVP9tgc)

Alrighty, the pros and cons.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: 

Marked as a buy/hold from various analysts.

Potential gap target: 0.80+

Support line: 0.10

PE: -0.02 (not bad)

PB: 1.00

Reasonable asset.

Theory wise, if they can manage to be a reasonable need or asset towards the company based on their recent announcement of using their airports as a testing center instead, this could turn around the company and potentially receive a debt waiver.

Price target reasonably at 1.24

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: 

Awful debt issue though not completely terrible. (ranked 24/39)

Recent public offering (though at least now that's out of the way, they could grow now that all the shorts squeezed out, moving forward).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall opinion, I'd say load when it dips at its peak since I see some high ticket bid orders at 0.10-0.11. XpresSpa seeks to support COVID-19 testing in 46 locations across 23 US Airports.

I have spent the last week online trying to market my survey to investors across various online communities including Reddit and LinkedIn. Unfortunately, I seem to be having a really low *response rate*, as of the approximately 90 people who have clicked on my survey, only 3 have completed it :(

I have edited the survey to be as lean as possible, and take the least amount of time to complete as I could make it. It really is only 10 minutes.

If you have prior experience in finance &amp; investment, an educated interest, or so much as hold some shares in a company and have some time to spare, I would really appreciate if you could complete a brief survey consisting of two short questionnaires revolving around *situation-based investment decisions, Agree-vs-Disagree questions,* and an *investor profile* for reporting prior experience and knowledge across several investment categories. Perhaps you may find it interesting or learn something new!

IMPORTANT: All important information is detailed in Page 1 of the survey.

The survey is available at the following link: [**https://lboro.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/investor-psychology-and-financial-risk-tolerance**](https://lboro.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/investor-psychology-and-financial-risk-tolerance)

somenamethatsclever	1584937361	"This is a long post.

I bought 1,450 opko stocks at 2.16 per share. Over the past 2 weeks this stock had a big increase and immediate drop back to 1.40. My plan was to sell at 3 and day trade through webull. Anything over 2.1 I am selling due to the high amount of short sellers, volatility, and bad CEO reputation. 

Even if I sell and it goes to 4 I consider that a win because with this stock it could easily bounce right back down. I'll be watching the market tmrw morning to get out and start day trading. Ill be watching the stock and if I see it break past 4 I can still earn a profit without holding the bag. I didn't come to gamble, I came to learn the penny stocks market. There were stocks that jumped and I knew I couldn't invest but didn't have the funds while in Opk.

Your situation may be different but for these reasons I'm cutting my losses."	Why I am selling opko	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fndue9/why_i_am_selling_opko/

rockandahardplace08	1584889937	"Im still holding out on a couple thousand shares of each, I was wondering about your guys thoughts with each.  

Ill start with ALT: So I heard about a 60 minutes segment that was airing tomorrow and featuring MNRA/INO, that I guess was my first question, do you think that show is going to have a negative or positive effect on ALT? I didn't see anywhere that ALT would be in it at all but the whole thing is talking about finding a vaccine and I have always liked the whole plan they have with the NasoVax vaccine they are going for. I also keep hearing that they have been looking for a partner, im going to copy/paste a post I keep seeing on yahoo finance/stocktwits.

$ALT There are 4 facts that need to be put together in order to come up with a prediction for us longs:   
1.  On Wednesday, GARG in an interviewed said that ALT's development is a contribution to public health, and that it would be a collaboration with government agencies and other stakeholders.  He was encouraged by $8.3B in fighting coronavirus.   
2. On Friday after the market closed, we learned that GARG had hired a Washington law firm to represent its interest in issues related to pandemic.   
3. In a PR late last month, Garg said he was actively engaged in discussion with a number of potential partners.   
4. Garg has met with Roth Capital multiple times (virtual meetings)   
   
Give those for facts, I think two scenarios may happen:   
   
1.  ALT would enter a contract with BARDA to produce coronavirus vaccine for the US government, similar to its current contract to produce anthrax vaccine (with contract value up to $133.7B).   
2. A buyout is in the work.   
 

I really like how ALT has been able to hold steady at 3 $ throughout all this crashing and really unpredictable markets for the last little while, it gives me hope that on any decent news we could see a good jump. what's your guys thoughts? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now OPK, so these guys have been mentioned in the latest white house briefing that was mentioned in another post and they have gotten a bunch of decent news throughout the last little while but any good news seems to make the PPS go down? its weird to me, even after the contract with the state of New York, that didn't seem to have a effect at all, now they are opening another drive through in New Jersey and still no effect, I was hoping yesterday the CV taskforce would of said something about the appeal for funds that the American Clinical Laboratory Association submitted for 5 billion, Bio reference was one of the labs listed.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/labs-testing-covid-19-seek-5-billion-in-u-s-emergency-funding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/labs-testing-covid-19-seek-5-billion-in-u-s-emergency-funding) 

But heres another post from someone on yahoo finance highlighting some of the other things going for opk

 Dr. Cohen on Morning Joe. Highlights:  


1. BRL seeing 3 groups, hospitals, doctors offices and drive thrus.  
2. Many states calling BRL for help setting up drive throughs.  
3. Original test from CD very slow. BRL bought in 4 different platforms IN ADDITION to CDC test (this is how they manage to do so many).  
4. Can do 10,000 test a day, 15,000 within the week, and scaling up to 20,000  
5. More demand than ability to test even at 20K/day  
6. Police and Fire departments calling about weekly proactive tests.  
7. With additional equipment and reagents could be 100,000 a day.  
8. NY City is primary 11 Hospitals  
9. Next limiting factor is swabs and then reagents

So I guess my question is with OPK, What in the hell is it going to take to see a jump in PPS with this one? they seem to be a promising company with a lot of testing being done, I know lots of people don't seem to like this Frost character, do you guys see this one getting a good jump soon?

&amp;#x200B;

benchieepenchie	1585757390	"Well, let me make it clear to you. I'm not an *expert* nor an *advisor*. I just want to share my DD at $KTOV, so you can give me your opinion about it.

First of all, $KTOV is a pharmaceutical company based in Israel without any long term debt. They do have a leverage ratio of 1.4, which is an average amount in the healthcare market \[1\]. The company only exists for about 4.5 years and started off with an IPO price of ¬± $3. Their stock price skyrocketed in 2016 when they announced a successful third phase result from their current drug \[2\].

Since then, they were developing a drug called 'Consensi^(TM)'. In 2018, the FDA approved this product for commercialization. I guess some political \~\~bullshit\~\~ stuff happened between then and now, but $KTOV announced that they are partnering with Coeptis Pharmaceutical. Coeptis Pharmaceutical is a *private* \~\~FUCK!\~\~ company and is engaged in acquisition, development, and commercialization of branded pharma products \[3\]. They both announced to start launching Consensi^(TM) in **May 2020** \[4\]!

You may wonder at this point, 'Yeah but what about the cash flow, dawg?'. $KTOV didn't make revenue from its IPO until 2017. The revenue started flowing in 2018, in which $KTOV accepted annual revenues of $1M from Coeptis Pharma in exchange for the commercialization of Consensi^(TM).

$KTOV is eligible to receive up to $99.5M in (commercial) milestones and royalties \[5\]. They will receive 20% of royalties and/or get a minimum of $4.5M for the following 3 years \[4\].

Sure, sounds good right? Well, there's more.

1. They also partnered for commercialization in China and South Korea \[6\]
2. Do you remember Consensi^(TM)? What the hell does this \~\~mouth\~\~\~product do?

a. Treat the pain from osteoarthritis

b. Treat the pain from hypertension

3. **Osteoarthritis** is the *most common* form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of your bones wears down over time \[7\].

4. **Hypertension** is also referred to as elevated high blood pressure. Approximately *1.13 billion* people have this serious medical condition \[8\].

5. Patients with these conditions could get treatment immediately since this is an oral medication; they could take them while in isolation (unless their arms are amputated).

$KTOV is determined to invest the money in the development of the new products 'CM-24' and 'NT-219'. Products that have to do with tumors and some witchcraft. I didn't do any research about those; I was already sold by the commercialization of Consensi^(TM).

What do you guys think? Did I miss out on something? I think this company has the potential to go $2+ in the long term. Stock may rise in the short term when the 2nd quarter 2020 earnings are announced.

jfh7j	1585724619	I‚Äôm exploring a trading strategy that involves shorting low-cap equities after they are ‚Äúpumped up‚Äù by the many online penny stock alerts and newsletters. I need data about which of these alerts/newsletters yield significant and consistent price spikes, and which equities are most susceptible to pump-ups. Is this kind of data available anywhere? I would be far happier paying for a spreadsheet with helpful information offered by a fellow reddit user than paying for penny stock pumpers with poor (and hidden) track records.

&gt;To break it down, it appears GCGX got all of its money back it paid for the equipment, plus the tenant improvements and all the money it spent getting the lease. This left the company in a very healthy financial position, which allowed it to divert a significant portion of dollars to increasing the brand, Indulge.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the filings today, the equipment was on the books for $800,000, while the brand it owns is valued at roughly $27 million dollars. This is a no-brainer for any cannabis producing company, as it essentially retained the money it spent for the equipment, which is now in full operation. As such, Indulge oils is what makes the company the income. ***The equipment (owned by the manufacturer entity) is just what processes the oil, which is then sold for profit for the company Indulge oils.***"	$GCGX looks like people read the Quarterly report wrong ha.

Knight_Aero	1586272259	"IMIMF is the OTC symbol for IMC International Mining Corp. There is an equal CSE symbol: IMCX. The gold mining and exploration company has honestly shown a lot of promise in the past month especially. IMIMF is just over .52 this morning has been climbing up over 80% from .28-.3ish in past 2-3 weeks since its recent land acquisition became official. There is another investor meeting this afternoon that will discuss more than likely the survey plans for its new land holding which has apparently proven profitable in the past. That survey originally was planned for end of April I believe. Assuming the Coronavirus situation doesn't cause delays and it trends like other mining stocks in the past, the price could easily exceed $1 or $1.50 by the time they start mining in a few weeks or months especially if the survey is extremely positive. Mining stocks can be really trick but this company seems to know what they are doing from what I have read. Thoughts?

TampaSunset	1587237636	"I‚Äôm going to skip past explaining what an Oil Contango is. Also if you haven‚Äôt noticed, we‚Äôre in an oil crash on top of all this covid-19 volatility. 

Regardless, OPEC and Russia are claiming they have come to a deal to cut production, it‚Äôs not true. The saudi‚Äôs can still maintain profit while prices are near $20 a barrel. Low prices is bad for the U.S. oil game. Russia and Saudi Arabia are in a good position financially when U.S. oil is not doing well. 

Anyways this is where this play comes in.

$NAT is an oil shipping tanker company. They store oil on large ships and charge lots of money to store oil. They are currently charging 5x what they used to 6 months ago due to the over supply of oil and demand for storage for said oil. 

Their CFO recently bought 60,000 shares for $4.725 on 3/30

[source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/nordic-american-tankers-ltd-nyse-175556983.html)

Another interesting thing to note is their [dividend history](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nat/dividend-history)

See the steep rise in 2014? That was last time barrel prices were dropping like they are now. 

**Low oil prices = good for oil storage tankers**

When they increase their dividends ‚Äî expect for institutional investors to hop in to secure nice dividends on a cheap stock. That‚Äôs going to be a huge jump in volume and it will send the price sky rocketing. Meanwhile, you‚Äôve been holding the whole timeüòâ

This is going to moon, hop in Monday. 

As of now, it‚Äôs trading for $4.06 I expect a movement to at least $6 maybe even $8 a share. 

Also, $STNG is another lucrative play but it‚Äôs not a penny stock...

superpaulx254	1587172477	"I've invested in a couple of penny stocks, reits, and common stocks  this month (new to trading).

Most of the penny stocks were related to biopharm (SONN, I sold $10k usd less than one hour before news by the way) and even random ones like TLBT and AKRX prior to the rs and surge respectively.

During this week, the market was going crazy with the ups and downs. My play to play off pumpers in CNK and PLAY got hit hard, and my high risk reits (NRZ, MFA) seemed to swing off the volatility off the Dow, SPY, and even the nasdaq.

But I noticed a lot of my penny stocks, aside from the reits, weren't heavily impacted by the overall market. In fact, I've even seen some of the pump and dump stocks go UP with no news at all.

Question: My question is how much of an impact does the overall market have with pump and dump penny stocks?  Thank you in advance

Knight_Aero	1587139671	So I have seen and heard about lines of resistance at just certain values regardless of history or trends. Like today with TRNX at the $.50 as a great example.

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the ‚Äúking‚Äù)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE‚Äôs and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

Cyclonecgs	1587071969	"Just wanted to drop a quick word about the conference call that Moleculin just had since it's confusing a lot of people (especially with the stock dipping, which I think is temporary)

In short, a study in Germany used 2-DG to prevent replication of COVID-19 using a human cell line. They were able to achieve 100% prevention at non-toxic levels. 2-DG is not a good drug candidate due to it's rapid metabolism by the body, so it does not reach target cells at useful concentrations. Moleculin has been working on a drug (WP1122) that is a pro-drug of 2-DG. WP1122 has much better up-take, and is able to reach target tissues at much higher concentrations than 2-DG with smaller doses. Once it is absorbed, it is broken down leaving 2-DG, the active component that was used in the German study. They are currently putting together everything they need for clinical trials, but do not yet have FDA approval, although they are confident under the circumstances it won't be long. They also mentioned they have adequate funding through Q1 2021.

TLDR: Moleculin's drug is a very promising COVID-19 treatment, they have the funding for trials, just need approval. 

(Also worth mentioning that I have a B.S. in Biodmedical science, and am a medical student, so I actually understood most of what they were talking about during the conference call and it all seemed like good news to me, but I don't have a PhD in this stuff.)"

I'm really interested in penny stocks/stocks in general and always have been but I'm stuck not knowing how to begin trading or what to do. I'm interested in trading penny stocks and making small profit because I'm not financially able to do a whole lot at a time right now so trading anything other than penny stock doesn't seem like a good fit.

I guess what I'm asking is, where do I begin? What do I do for a beginner who's interested but has little knowledge about stock market? And lastly, is trading penny stock profitable? If so how?

justasbadasyou	1587447692	"Company Profile: TOPS Ships Inc.

Ticker: TOPS
 
Description:

TOPS is a Greek-based company that owns and operates numerous vessels that are used to transport oil and chemical products. According to their website, they own modern and fuel-efficient vessels and have high standards of performance, reliability, and safety. They currently own and operate nine product and chemical tankers along with two crude oil tankers. They have a reputable management team, and their CEO founded the company in 2000, with experience in the shipping company since 1992. They take pride in their professionalism with the people they hire to maintain and operate their vessels and how environmentally friendly they are using new technology and having a ""young"" set of ships compared to other companies. 

Bull Thesis:

Currently, with oil prices negative, this stock could quickly go up for a quick gain. These companies will need to store their oil somewhere, and TOPS could benefit them. This is prime to make some moves, and I believe they could have some more good news in the upcoming weeks, and that could increase their stock prices.

Bear Thesis:

Their current vessels are already contracted, but that won't stop inexperienced investors from hopping on the bandwagon. Also, they could buy new ships or figure out ways to profit from the oil drop. Either way, I believe in the short term, this stock could increase. 

Financials:

Financials aren't necessarily the best; they will most likely continue to pollute their stock and continue to have offerings. They agreed not to make an offer for the next two and a half weeks so that we could see an increase up until then and a potential drop. Like many companies, they are in much debt, but their revenue has dramatically increased from 2018 to 2019, as well their assets have increased from 2018-2019 by around 17%. They are looking to expand and become a profitable company. 

Potential 2020 Catalyst

Continuation to acquire and operate new vessels 

Authors Note: 

This stock has a low market-cap of a bit over 283M, and with the closing price of just about $1.58 on April 20, 2020, I believe this is an excellent stock for either a day trader or long term hold. They will most likely continue to dilute this stock further to raise money for operating costs and continuing to acquire new vessels, but long term, it looks like they could be a leader in the shipping industry."

justasbadasyou	1587447627	"Company Profile: VBI Vaccines Inc.

Ticker: VBIV

Description:
 
VBIV is a commercial-stage biotech company that specializes in producing a few different antivirus vaccines. According to their website, they are developing next-generation vaccines and immunotherapeutics to address unmet needs in infectious diseases and immuno-oncology"". They are developing new and advanced technology that are on the brink to help combat the need for the healthcare industry. Motley Fool recently wrote about an article that included them titled ""Why These COVID-19 Vaccine Stocks Soared Today"". Their headquarters are located in the US, research in Canada and they are manufactured in Israel. 

Bull Thesis:

Unlike some pharmaceutical companies in clinical trials, VBIV has SIX drugs in their trials, so if one or two fail, it might not be a huge deal. If these drugs see the light of day, shareholders could have a field day with their profits.

Bear Thesis:

Like all biotech companies, VBIV is risky, but they seem to have a safety net with the amount of products they could produce. They may dilute their stock but would only affect short term prices.

Financials:

Their earnings dropped from 2018-2019 by over 50%, and their net income in 2019 was -1,117%. With the approval and continuation of their drugs could move the company in the right direction to make a profit and have the potential to become a significant player in the pharmaceutical industry. 

Potential 2020 Catalyst 

-Continuation of their six drugs in clinical trials and potential approval of a few
-Potential buyout or partnership opportunity (pure speculation)
-JPM Conference April 22, 2020

Authors Note:

This stock has a low market-cap of a bit over 32M, and with the closing price of just about 28 cents on April 20, 2020, I believe this is an excellent stock for either a day trader or long term hold, although an offering may have an impact on the stock which isn't necessarily likely, but they will eventually need to raise money. They have a decent amount of pharmaceuticals in the pipeline and potential for releasing next-level technology."

Geo81	1587414331	"Beautiful chart! Cup&amp;handle completing! Boom time!: 

And it is worth noting that tomorrow, Tuesday, will be the end of the 5th week of this consolidation pattern, which William J. O'Neil, publisher of Investor's Business Daily, and Owner of O'Neil &amp; Co, one of the top institutional research firms on Wall street, says in his books is the minimum duration of an ideal Cup &amp; Handle chart pattern. I mentioned this duration last week as something I would gladly wait for until the breakout occurs, and now we are there. Will it happen? Tomorrow, Wednesday, this week, very possibly! The way this chart looks, the 50dma and 200dma both now uptrending, all secondary indicators favorable, I wouldn't be surprised if this broke out tomorrow! But I suspect it will shortly regardless! 

And the timing from the fundamental side is fantastic, with much more news likely to be coming as we go forward, very positive news, in a host of areas, not just purchase orders, which will be among them. Fundamentals and technicals lining up together! Fantastic! 

This is the real deal, and the chart and timing are perfect for a major breakout and new uptrend beginning! 

And when it breaks out, I could easily see it running thru the key $.094 resistance and the nearby natural resistance at $.10, to begin the climb! If it does so on big volume, and then follows thru, that's the key final ingredient. And remember, the market invests on future value, to the greatest extent with strong growth companies, especially early in their growth, which is exactly what we have here, but in this case, with every reason to believe that growth not only will be accelerating, but will be going on for many years to come, globally! 

Long &amp; Strong! Into dollar land and beyond!

NormanMitis	1587346028	"I've been a full time OTC trader since 2006 and my style of trading/investing is to find the few quality setups and trade them for longer term swing trades. A few months tend to be the longest I'll hold but if the play warrants it, I will adapt. Enter $DFCO.

I first stumbled upon $DFCO in January 2018 when it when from defunct to filing financials again with OTC Markets. That sparked the stock to run 1500% in a day (breaking out of a 9 year base) and then it began to consolidate it's gains. That consolidation was what first caught my eye. Most OTCs that run that hard get dumped hard soon after, so when I see a stock run like crazy AND hold it's gains, that means it's accumulation. And my style of trading is to follow the big boys and when they accumulate that heavily, so do I.

Fast forward to now and the once defunct company is making steady progress but it wasn't until this past week that the price action finally picked up again. Then on Thursday and Friday it made back to back new 11 year high closes, setting the stage for a continuation of that 2018 rally. This is mega long term play in action so I fully expect this to have legs. There will be volatility for sure, ups down and consolidation along the way, but I expect the uptrend to sustain itself for a long period of time. I always encourage traders to take some profits into strength to lock in some gains and limit overall risk at that stage, but then when a play has this sort of potential you need to let some run.

Best chart in the OTC by far right here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/K39erN3g/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/K39erN3g/)

I've been singing it's praises for 2 years now and though the price has held up well, the lack of volume has kept the market uninterested. I kept telling people buy up the .03s and .04s while the volume was low because once volume picks up you're paying much higher. Oh well, I tried. Retail traders love to chase volume.. so here comes the volume.

* In a solid downward wedge
* Triple bottom (2 on 4/16, one on 4/17)
* MACD signal close to MACD, but looks like it's trending to move above
* Higher than average volume since about 4/9
* RSI is at about 44.5, not bad, but also not great

Here's my TA with lines and everything, I'm still pretty new to TA so I could be misclassifying something or missed some other indicator.

ApprovedSwag	1587309695	"I‚Äôm new to penny stock trading and from some of the post I‚Äôve read; well I guess the golden rule is to buy low/sell high. I tend to get greedy when I see green and then I disappoint myself. 

I have a few shares in Groupon. I bought at .83 and I‚Äôve had it for a few weeks now. It‚Äôs always up and down. 

I purchased TOPS at .22. It‚Äôs started to gain and then dropped. I lost a few dollars. Same thing with SHIPS.

So I guess my question is: do you sell and just take any profit you make?

Thatguyfromdeadpool	1587308398	"So, the sad thing about the Stock trading world is that there are some people that like to lie with how much they are actually making. Why would they do that though ? Well... In order to trick others into following them or worse, into buying their ""courses"".

So i'm writing this to let you guys know that Yes, it is possible(quite easily) for people to lie about their gains. Since I know A LOT of people will either Blindly follow others or will get roped into Discord groups that charge people for ""Mentorship"" programs, I wanted to make sure I could help you guys with what to look out for, so you don't get tricked.

You'll notice a pattern though... The ones that have a high % of being fake are the ones that are posted from the website of the trading platform that they use. You can easily edit the information on the trading Platform websites. You would need to use Photoshop to Fake the ones from the Desktop/Mobile app itself.

You can also catch certain details that could provide more proof that their Website ""Gains"" are not real. For instance when a Number that is in the thousands doesn't even have a Comma(,) . I have not seen a website itself not have the comma in there, unless it's been human error.

These are just a few examples though on what to look out for, some people can be creative it seems in ""faking it"", so be careful out there."

itsmarkcarson	1587303867	"Good morning all. Here is my DD on some stonks. Google Doc didn't copy the links I attach to some of the statements so I guess you'll still have to find it on your own.

$NAT - ($4.03) Nordic American Tankers Limited, a tanker company, acquires and charters double-hull tankers in Bermuda and internationally. It operates a fleet of 23 Suezmax crude oil tankers. A single suezmax carries about 800,000 to more than 1,000,000 barrels.

NEWS:
May 18th Q1 Earning
Share buy back program is decided March 18th

CFO bought 60,000 shares @ $4.75 March 30th
EVP bought 84,000 shares @ $3.37 March 25th 
(EVP is responsible for employing tankers)
CEO‚Äôs son bought 350,000 shares @ $2.92 March 24th
New Vice Chairman March 27th
They seem to release statements pretty frequently for the past 2 months.

Volume: 2.9 million

BALANCE:
Total assets just over $1 billion. 
(129 million in current assets)
(62 million in cash)

Total liabilities $432 million
(59 million in current liabilities, 375 million in long-term debt)
(operating cost is $8,000 daily)

*2019 the company was up 135% in accounts payable.

INCOME:
2019 Gross Profit 45 million.
More recently the CEO sent a letter showing 12 current contracts from March averaging $68,500 per day extending for the next 60 days.
With the current oil climate I expect demand for tankers to increase.

Also the CEO has made it clear: ‚ÄúDividend are a priority‚Äù as it mentioned in almost every article.

Summary:
It's a go for me. This stock has seen better days at 20 million+ volume and prices well over $20. ‚Äò08 crash they saw a positive bump and ‚Äò15 they saw another one. Hoping the bump during this crash will be a spike.
Looking for stock to double in Q2. Would be confident holding longer too. Going to be buying in Monday.


$EROS - ($4.00) Eros International Plc, together with its subsidiaries, co-produces, acquires, and distributes Indian language films in various formats worldwide. News has it Eros will merge with STX Entertainment, a private company. Financial terms didn‚Äôt come out, but I would assume STX would now operate in the public legal shell of Eros. Sometimes this works &amp; sometimes the deal doesn‚Äôt go thru. Given the current market situation, STX might be using this as a quick play to go public 
Typically a merger can take 3-4 months.

Volume: 20 million

$EROS Balance Sheet:
Over $1 billion in total assets

430 million in liabilities, 200 million is current debt.

INCOME: 
114 million Gross Profit but -400 million Net Income.

Overall Eros has been on a downtrend from the start.

STX:
STX Entertainment was valued by multiple sources at $1.5 billion.
They made ‚ÄúThe Upside‚Äù with Kevin Hart. A movie I‚Äôve never heard about. Just watched the trailer, not sure what to think but let me guess, he dies at the end. $125 million box office. Budget 37.5 million.

Mile 22 - 66 million box office (lead role by Marky Mark!) budget 35 million. 21% on rotten tomatoes.
Ugly Dolls - 32 million box office. Budget 45 million. Most recent release/kids movie. 27% rotten tomatoes.
The Edge of 17 - 18 million box office. Budget was 9 million. 94% rotten tomatoes.
The Foreigner - 145 million box office. (Jackie Chan!) Budget 35 million.

Summary:
Most of their movies are profitable. Could be potential there but personally I‚Äôm not a fan of any of these movies and I don‚Äôt think Eros Bollywood audience will be either. 
Hate to be the downer but this merger play just seems like a handful of hope.
Who knows, maybe the merger goes well and the stock hits $16.79 by July.


$TRNX- ($0.34) The company offers MagneGas, a hydrogen-based synthetic fuel that is used as an alternative to acetylene and other natural gas derived fuels for metal cutting and other commercial uses. It also provides Plasma Arc Flow System for MagneGas production, or water decontamination and sterilization. In addition, the company sells and licenses its proprietary plasma arc technology.

News:
Taronis had previously been notified of a minimum bid deficiency, given relief until June 30th to hit $1.00.
Company decided against a reverse split! Good news, they must be confident! Could just be a pump tho right?

Volume: 697 million
This has dummy momentum.

Hold on a second, this stock was once traded for $26,000???? I don‚Äôt know about that. Look at the 5 year chart.

Balance:
27 million in assets, almost no cash.
4 million in liabilities. 

Income:
Gross profit: 8 million
Net Income: -24 million

Summary:
This company hasn‚Äôt been profitable in years.
Not liking the way these numbers are looking.
Read rumors somewhere that Taronis Technology is licensing patents to Taronis Fuel. 
Maybe I‚Äôm missing something here. It's a no go for me.

$PUMP - ($3.50) (+25% on Friday) ProPetro Holding Corp., an oilfield services company, provides pressure pumping and other related services. The company offers hydraulic fracturing services; and a suite of well completion and production services, including cementing, acidizing, coiled tubing, flowback, surface air drilling, and drilling services. 
What struck my interest was oil field maintenance &amp; services. 

News:

Stockholder rights plan April 14th. Mentions the rights the shareholders would have if the company happens to get bought out in the next year. 
Investigation on behalf of stockholders April 11th

So, like many others I ignored him. I invested most of my hard earned cash into this endeavor, along with most of my 401k. 

Now, I need to explain to my wife and her boyfriend that *yours truly* yolo'd everything they had into a company with a 1997 Angelfire website, fronted by a man named Bozo Berman with a questionable past who claimed to have a *game changing* product that even the FDA couldn't comprehend. I'm dead.

AspiringPhysician7	1587861125	"I know DECN is being investigated by SEC for some bold claims and possibly due to a massive sell-off a few days ago. I want to focus this post on the testing aspect because as a future healthcare provider, I am very interested in the technology that they claim to have ""perfected"" and I aspire to give my patients the best care that I can. 

So let's jump into it, DECN claim to have perfected their technology because they use their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in their glucose meters and they are recalibrating it for detection of coronavirus, which is not as crazy as one would think after looking into it.

I have been doing some research because there is a lot of misunderstanding of what DECN's test kits actually are.

* **Test Kit #1** (currently pending FDA approval). This is a test kit for hospitals, labs, and clinics to use. This test uses a technology called electrical impedance. This is how I imagine it. There is a circuit and electricity is running through it at a certain voltage and frequency. Now once you add things to that circuit (such as a blood sample) that will cause some sort of resistance and using the Ohm's Law (Voltage=Current\*Resistance), we know that will cause a change in the voltage that is produced. This is the reason why the results come out so fast because it's literally electrons running through the circuit. (Please correct me if I am wrong. I would love to learn more about this technology). Now the reason why this is important is that different types of microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and etc... cause a different amount of resistance. Based on how much resistance is changed is how they can distinguish, in this case, if you have coronavirus or not.
* **Test Kit #2** (going to file with the FDA before 5/1). This uses the same technology as above and is going to be an at-home test kit. **TK#1** and **TK#2** ARE NOT serology tests. They are NOT looking for antibodies. They are looking for the presence of the coronavirus in red blood cells that have been lysed (cut open) which I assume happens when the voltage runs through the blood sample in the device.

Now that has been cleared up, let's move on to the perfection of this ""technology."" I DO NOT KNOW if they have truly perfected it. I will, however, say that there have been scientific studies (which I will link below) that show that this technology can be compared to the sensitivity (correctly detect positive result) and specificity (correctly detect negative result) of PCR. With that said, there are some limitations to what I have come across.

1. Study #1 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088225/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088225/)) This study used nasal samples (not blood, I know different sample type) to assess the at what concentration they could detect the presence of different microorganisms (they used it for MERS-CoV and not for COVID-19). With that said, if you read at graphical abstract... you can see a diagram that looks VERY SIMILAR to that used in the GENVIRO product.
2. Study #2 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4563260/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4563260/)) This study is the CLOSEST one that I have found to our actual product technology. The only issue is they did not use it to detect this coronavirus because this study came out before COVID-19 was around. It does not take away from the fact that this technology COULD POSSIBLY BE used to detect COVID-19 if more studies support it.
3. Study #3 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21872621](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21872621)) This study is the shortest to read of the 3, but they were assessing the avian flu (H5N2). With this study, they found that electrical impedance was very COMPARABLE to PCR. They got their results within an hour whereas rRT-PCR (this is how most swab tests are being run) would take much longer (several hours to possibly days).

What's the takeaway? More studies need to be done to see if electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used to detect COVID-19. Also, more studies on COVID-19 need to be done, because these studies I have came across are looking at different types of viruses. From my research, I am not seeing detection in 15 seconds, but I have seen some authors claim within minutes. However, with that said, it's possible that DECN may have this technology ""perfected"" with their colleagues in South Korea.

At this point, it's really up in the air if this product has the capability to back up it's **bold** (see what I did there) claims.

I won't even mention the ticker. We all know it. That ticker that we thought was going higher. We were told it was going higher. We did our calculations what we'd make. The cars. The gratification. The success.

All gone in minutes.

Things changed. The mood took a dark turn. What was once the blissful opportunity to make money, all gone. Sweating. Shaking. Heart pounding. It's all over. The dream of a blissful prospect, vanished.

Dead silence.

# PENNY STOCKS ARE NOT SMART LONG-TERM POSITIONS

I don't care what so-and-so trading guru says to his chatroom of pumpers right before he dumps his shares minutes later and cashes in on their hype, DO NOT BUY PENNY STOCKS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SAFE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. With their level of volatility, penny stocks are *realistically* *only a worthwhile play for high-volume swing/momentum traders and pattern day traders* to make. You are not going to get rich years from now and turn 1000x profit by putting $200 into some $0.07 bio-pharma startup today. You just aren't.

# SET REALISTIC PRICE TARGETS

100%+ gain is NOT a realistic target. 50% gain is NOT a realistic target. 30% gain is NOT a realistic target. Get this get-rich-quick, I turned $400 into 40 million, make-one-trade-and-retire BULLOCKS out of your head NOW and stop watching your profits vanish into thin air because you expect the stock fairy to magically come down out of the sky and give you the golden ticker to fantasy land. Secure your profits when you see them. 5-15% GAIN IS A GOOD TRADE, so set your damn Stop Loss and be thankful you ended up in the green. No, you're not a ""penny flipper."" No, you don't have ""weak hands"" or whatever the fuck the daft chucklefucks on StockTwits and DECN threads are calling it. You have **money**. You have the results of a good trade in your brokerage account. It doesn't matter if the stock goes up more. It doesn't matter if the stock goes down to $0.00 the next day. You are out of it with what you intended to get out of it, and you're now in a position to make your next trade. Good stocks don't just suddenly disappear out of the market because you took your gains a little early and the stock you sold pulled a miracle run and went up another 30% after you left. DO NOT TRADE WITH EMOTION. TRADE WITH STATISTICS.

# DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE

Do not buy a stock because somebody posts ""$*SHIT about to BLAST OFF to MOON LAND get your ROCKETS and LAMBOS ordered guyss!! LOLOLOL.*"" That is not DD. Look up the company you're buying into, look at recent news about the company you're buying into, and please - **if there's only one bit of DD you do, make it this** \- LOOK AT THE PATTERN THE STOCK IS CURRENTLY TRADING ON A PROPER CANDLESTICK CHART AND TRADE ACCORDINGLY. Do not invest in stocks that do not pass common-sense inspection. You will lose your money nearly every single time. If it's too good to be true, it is. If the one-in-a-million situation comes up where it was true, it still doesn't matter to you because you were off making good money on a much better trade and you didn't even come back to notice. ***Ignore the chatter, buy the pattern***.

# IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE BASICS OF TRADING, DON'T FUCKING TRADE YET!

If you have to ask how to read a candlestick chart, what a stop loss is, how to place a limit order, what ''ETF'' stands for, when the market is open, etc. - YOU ARE NOT READY TO TRADE. I do not understand this. You wouldn't attempt to race a car on a speedway without knowing how to drive, you wouldn't attempt to perform heart surgery without advanced medical training, so why on earth would you sit back and put your money at risk without knowing what you're getting into? There are plenty of FREE resources on YouTube that cover the basics of tradings, chart patterns, market terminology, all of it. You're not going to start off with the experience of a 30-year veteran broker, but you at least need to know the core of what you're doing before you start buying and selling shares. If searching for information on your own bores you or is too complicated or time-consuming, then trading isn't for you anyway.

# DON'T RISK WHAT YOU CAN'T LOSE

As with all risky ventures, there is always the chance that you will log on to your brokerage platform and see that your account has significantly less value than it did mere moments ago. While following your common sense, doing good DD, and only trading stocks that have good patterns shown in their charts will minimize this chance by a very large amount, it can still happen. Good trades can fail. Bad trades can win. The market can be fickle. Penny stocks aren't the place to be investing your retirement fund or the money you got from taking out a mortgage.

# DON'T TRADE ON ROBINHOOD

This is really going to rub some people the wrong way, but that's fine. I'm not going to get into why RH lacks certain features that make trading easier because you'll find that out on your own in time. The main reason I've added this to the list is much simpler - RH only lets you trade from 9:00 AM EST to 6 PM EST. You will miss out on most non-market hours moves. I personally use Webull, which allows you to trade from 4 AM EST to 8 PM EST and also offers 0-commission trading in the same manner that RH does. Also, if you plan on trading OTC stocks (which I can't honestly recommend), you will need a broker that supports them. RH doesn't. Find one that does - but be ready to pay commissions on those trades.

# CHECK THE DATE OF A POST BEFORE YOU BUY A STOCK

I've had people post hate on stock watch list ideas I've posted nearly a week after I posted them. If a post on January 5th says ""\[STOCK\] is looking good for a run"" and you look the stock up on January 14th and see it went up 35% between January 7th and January 8th, chances are good that the post is no longer actively valid advice.

jus_in_bello	1587835407	"Disclaimer: I'm a bag holder. I broke my own rule and got sucked into the FOMO. Lesson learned. I'm also a new investor, so please correct me if any of the following is incorrect. 

A lot of the posts about DECN explore whether the company is legit or shady. There seems to be some hope among other DECN holders that the company just got caught up with other COVID scammers and will eventually be cleared. There is even some people claiming to have talked to the owner and, based on his response, everything is going to be okay. No, it will not. 

The SEC does not issue a suspension lightly, and the fact that they did in this case supports my belief that there is some credibility to the question of fraud. However, my belief doesn't matter, and if you believe the SEC was in the wrong, good for you. The fact remains the same - the stock is now almost certainly worthless. 

Here's why. An SEC suspension is a near death sentence for OTC stocks. While the stock is suspended, it will be delisted and move to what's called the Grey Market. Sure, after the suspension is lifted trading can resume, but buyers and sellers will not be able to see what the bid/ask prices, meaning, you're trading blind. If you're selling, you list the stock at whatever price you think there is a buyer for and hope for the best. And, that's IF your broker even honors your order to sell, which they are not obliged to do. Indeed, your broker may just stop listing the stock altogether. The vast majority of SEC suspended stocks that resume trading on the grey market eventually die out. 

Is there hope? Not much. Yes, it's possible for a stock to resume trading normally. However, it will take some strict hurdle jumping and a lot of time. Even then, history is not on DECN's side. Since 2010, some 3,400 stocks have been suspended by the SEC and less than five have gotten off of the grey market. I could only find three - EDVP (now PRLX), SDRG (which no longer trades after a second suspension), and PHOT. 

TL:DR - Regardless of if DECN is a legit company or shady, the stock is worthless."	The posts about DECN are missing the point	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7xd2o/the_posts_about_decn_are_missing_the_point/

bighead-100	1587806468	"After much thought I think that I have figured out what DECN is doing. This  by no means meant to be investor advice because I am half baked at the moment so do your own DD and don't take financial advise from Reddit. 

1. FDA Commissioner Dr Hahn says that Trump ordered any and all  barriers to market for anti body test be removed. Companies can self certify with an insert in packaging. There is no standard for what the accuracy has to be that I can find, only that they have to put an insert in packaging with test results in packaging to get approval that's it besides having a product obviously
2. South Korea started using an antibody test similar to DECN in December/January but was not very accurate but fast. DECN works heavily with these companies.
3. DECN decides that they can make and market these inaccurate tests under guise of FDA approval internationally and sales in USA
4. DECN decides to pump there stock with PR's with rookie mistakes that would get them halted
5. DECN gets halted then resumes ten days later stock tanks to maybe grey market  
6. DECN gobbles up millions shares at .01
7. DECN provides proof of FDA approval and product they go back to pink sheets and moons back up.
8. DECN continues to sell all products and life goes on for them

After hours of research I found a ton on this and there evil genius CEO. They put a lot of time and money into this for it to be pump and dump the CEO is not stupid he is pulling some shit I am sure of that but I am also sure that they have a product that can meet the BS standards of self certification. I think his long play is to buy up as many share as he can at .01 or as near to it as necessary then makes out like a bandit when his company moons on news and then what can anyone do if the product shit. its FDA approved and the testing result insert is in there in microprint he walks away with millions. this test is needed right now because Government needs these tests to get economy going. after all the BS this guys is pulled and got away with I have faith he will pull this off as well nlt the question is how do we profit as well"	DECN fraud figured out and it is not what you think	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7qpc7/decn_fraud_figured_out_and_it_is_not_what_you/

maalmaal	1587767233	"this thread may help some rookies. my strategy was to scan for penny stocks, on a 52 week high, with a high traffic volume. i bought over 1,000 shares of Enservco (ENVS) and 200 of Abraxas (AXAS) at open during their peak. I wanted to buy stocks on the incline instead of what was flat or declining because I wanted I assumed they were performing well. But as soon as I refreshed the page it immediately started dipping red. Now it seems like a bad idea to buy within that first 10 minutes after opening? It feels like the rhythm is to sell and then buy after the first hour or so when the market stabilizes?

also, i'm quickly realizing that the stock market is heavily influenced by the news. it's not monty fool, zacks, or mad money who has the quickest insight- it's news blogs. I've noticed that all of the health care stock spikes are usually related to a write up in an academic or business website first. these articles are the key i think.

If your money is locked in DECN while it's halted, the absolute worst thing you can do is let these people get your your head and spin you into a frenzy. There's a whole mob of people screaming in everyone's ears

""I TOLD YOU! YOU'RE ALL FUCKING DELUSIONAL! YOU'RE FUCKED! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!!""

Then you have the other end of the spectrum assuring you that this is just a bump in the road and everything is going to be fine, and then go right back to the moon.

Lets be realistic, that is, at the very least, currently, not a good thing. It's also not the end of the world. It's an investigation, and nothing is set in stone yet, and nobody knows what the fuck is going on.

So please, don't let the whirlwind of vitriol and insanity that is going on in this sub right now get you so worked up that you vomit. First of all, it's just money. Second of all, it's an investigation **not a judgement or conviction**, and we don't have all the answers yet. Take a deep breath, 

Take a deep breath, and try to not let everyone drive you fucking insane. Literally, take a deep breath, and count to 10.

I have been following over 2 years because I thought trump might do a pro coal/coke america steel promotion, but china and covid have dropped them over $7.  I know they are hurting and at their low of low, but coal, coke, steel production arent going to stop anytime soon and america and china tariff bleh makes it very pro usa, and if the economy recovers maybe worth it?

When my money was locked up in DECN for a week I was getting a little impatient wanting to invest in other stocks. Right now my funds have to settle since I have a cash account. There were a couple stocks I was looking at that already went up a good amount today and I was disappointed at first that I couldn‚Äôt buy them. I have to remind myself that there are always going to be good stocks to buy. Just be patient. You don‚Äôt always have to get in on every stock that is mentioned or that you‚Äôre looking at. On Monday or Tuesday I‚Äôm sure there will be different stocks that come up that I might end up investing in instead of the ones I am watching right now.

spanky-jr	1587740900	"$VRUS just released that they received their first order for $800,000 for their disposable medical gowns. Company put a 30% deposit on for the order. Maybe a good one to get into for the long haul? Been watching this company for quite some time and they have been on a steady improvement despite very little movement in their price.

Their PR:

Gaithersburg, MD, April 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verus International, Inc. (‚ÄúVerus‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (OTCQB: VRUS)) is pleased to announce this update on its new medical supply division. The Company has finalized its first order, a $820,000 (USD) agreement for disposable medical gowns for a Danish customer. As it is customary with large production orders to receive an upfront deposit of at least 20% of the order total, the Company received a 30% deposit for this order. This initial order could expand into additional and larger orders in the future.

As part of the master plan to manufacture and develop a complete line of protective medical supplies, Verus is organizing its new medical division under the Verus Cares name. The Company has named Anders Gratte as President of the new division. As a co-owner of the Top Apparel Manufacturing (TAM) transaction, Mr. Gratte has significant experience with manufacturing and sales in the division‚Äôs target markets. His international experience is extensive and includes successful business start-ups in Sweden, Denmark, Philippines, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States.

‚ÄúWe are very excited to have someone of Anders‚Äô caliber join the Verus team,‚Äù said Verus CEO Anshu Bhatnagar. ‚ÄúHis international business experience is exceptional and his knowledge of manufacturing and sales in the protective medical supply market will give us a fast start as we begin to sign orders. We plan to develop a diversified product line that includes masks, gowns and other protective gear, giving us a full product offering with global appeal.‚Äù

In terms of operations, the logistical issues have improved to the point where the Verus Cares division expects to begin shipping sample quantities of masks within just a few weeks to prospective customers. Verus Cares has a significant number of contingent customer orders, pending approval of sample quantities, in addition to a growing number of request for quotes (RFQs) from large global entities seeking new sources of supply."	$VRUS	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7a0to/vrus/

I warned you guys about DECN pumpers few days back. Now, as we know, SEC has halted DECN due to their outrageous claims of ""perfect technology"" and forecasting that ""several hundred million kits will be sold"". I thought all the pumpers would go away now but I see a lot of people are still spreading misinformation and telling everyone to ""hold"" when trading resumes and that it'll be alright. 

FALSE

An SEC halt is no joke. It usually only happens when people are being scammed big times and when the company is grossly misrepresenting something that is attracting investors. 

If trading resumes on May 7th, which it should given DECN corrects itself and SEC is satisfied that they won't do anything more misrepresentation, then this will drop to .10s. And may slowly crawl back to either .20s or back to pennies depending on the update then. 

Anyone saying that this is going back to $0.50 is simply living in fools paradise and probably has a heavy bag themselves.

Good luck all. Do your DD, don't believe pumpers &amp; get out while you still can, when it resumes on May 7th."	DECN Pumpers - V2.0	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g79ogc/decn_pumpers_v20/

dlizano	1587710211	"CYLC 


CYLC has a tiny float of less than 1.5M shares which makes the stock more susceptible to volatility if demand hits.

Shares were also trading roughly 5x higher than current levels earlier this year!

CYLC is looking like a ground-floor situation that could zoom higher as more Americans consider growing plants and cannabis at home.

The coronavirus has changed life for many and being able to grow plants at home without having to go to the dispensaries could be a relief to millions of people.

And if marijuana becomes legalized on a federal level, the market will just grow even larger for the company's growing systems.

A countertop version of the company's game changing growing system could be huge!

Wall Street may be about to get a major wake up call to this thriving and exciting Cannabis company that is trading at just pennies!


CYLC has a history of quick jumps that can produce tremendous returns in the short-term.

This may be attributed to the fact that CYLC has a tiny float of under 1.5M shares according to OTCMarkets.

Low float stocks are considered very volatile vehicles and if Wall Street discovers how tiny CYLC‚Äôs float is, it could potentially lead to readers netting some monstrous profits.

The stock has doubled or tripled in just days many times over.

Recently on 3/23, shares moved from $0.06 to $0.1298 on 3/24 for a gain of over 100%!

Shares then sailed even higher to hit $0.18 on 4/1 representing a gain of 200% in less than two weeks!

CYLC was over 30 cents in January and over 45 cents this past October. There could be an epic bounce poised to happen if traders learn more about the company's growing systems.

The upside potential if shares move back to the stock's 52-week high would represent colossal gains of over 300%!"	CYLC	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g73g5s/cylc/

ShitPostGuy	1587690110	"The following is my own DD regarding BBRW. I am not a financial adviser nor an investment professional. Securities investments are speculative in nature and involve substantial risk of loss. I encourage you to consider all investments carefully. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*The Facts\*

BBRW is an established manufacturer of high-quality fermentation and distillation equipment and systems for the craft-brewing and craft-distillery industries. You can view a sample of their products here: [https://www.kinnek.com/brewbilt/#products](https://www.kinnek.com/brewbilt/#products) in 2018, they were awarded Start-Up of the Year by the Sacramento District of the Small Business Administration [https://www.theunion.com/news/business/exemplifying-excellence-byers-enterprises-brewbilt-manufacturing-llc-receive-honors/](https://www.theunion.com/news/business/exemplifying-excellence-byers-enterprises-brewbilt-manufacturing-llc-receive-honors/) They have also entered the market for cannabis extraction systems, their equipment extracts CBD and other compounds from hemp and cannabis for use in CBD infused products. BBRW currently leases an 8000 sqft manufacturing facility in Grass Valley, CA at a monthly rent of $4,861 and plans to lease an additional 7600 sqft expansion of manufacturing space in the same building.

In November 2019, BBRW acquired VetOnlineSupply, a publicly traded company selling CBD infused pet products, changed its ticker symbol to BBRW, the former leadership of VetOnlineSupply now manages the CBD pet supplies devision of Brewbuilt. As part of this merger, the newly formed company authorized the issue $5m of Preferred Series A stock to Jef Lewis, the President and CEO of Brewbuilt. As of December 31, 2019 these shares have not been issued and are recorded on the balance sheet as a liability of $2,289,884 in goodwill impairment and $2,289,884 of paid in capital. As part of the merger, $15,347,154 of VetOnlineSupply‚Äôs derivative liabilities were reassessed to a fair market value of $2,273,269 as well as a $5,077 debt to equity swap.

&amp;#x200B;

\*On to the balance sheet:\*

As of December 31, 2019 BBRW had $949,010 in assets, $435,164 of those being tangible. They also held $6,810,483 in total liabilities. As previously mentioned, $2,273,269 of that is derivative liabilities from the merger. Additionally, $1,511,096 are for sales which have been invoiced but not yet delivered. Assuming the company can fill all its current orders and the derivative liability from VetSupplyOnline is resolved, the total current liabilities are $2,325,567. As of Dec 31st 2019, BBRW had a book value of $949,010.

In the year 2019, BBRW did $1,589,728 in sales at a margin of 24%, subtracting operational expenses yields an operational loss of $594,237. As of December 31, they did not have enough cash on hand to cover a similar operating loss in 2020. I believe this is why they chose to purchase VetSupplyOnline, in order to raise money from the sale of their common stock or through the sale of warrants

The balance sheet from December 31st paints a picture of a company which is  growing quickly, but has not yet reached a sales volume to overcome its fixed costs. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Compensation:\*

Currently Jef‚Äôs compensation is entirely wrapped up the $5million of class A stock issued to him in the merger. He takes a salary of $200,000 per year and can choose to convert unpaid salary to shares of common stock at market price. Currently he is only expected to take $130,000 of that salary in cash.

The Previous CEO of VetSupplyOnline, Daniel Rushford, receives a salary of $36,000 but also owns 8 million shares of the outstanding common stock shares. They announced a cash dividend to be paid at the end of 2020 to everyone holding common stock and Jan 1 of 2020. This is where Dan will likely derive the majority of his income.

BBRW‚Äôs total expenses related to salaries is $515,638 which represents 47% of their fixed costs.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Risks:\*

This is a penny stock for a reason. The biggest risk, besides the continued unprofitability of the company, is potential CEO Scumbagery. At the end of 2019, there where 10 million outstanding shares of common stock, that number has tripled in the last 4 months which significantly dilutes the value for anyone holding shares. But Jef controls 100% of the class B voting shares and is authorized to issue up to 5 billion shares of common stock without prenotifying shareholders. This would obviously wipe out anyone‚Äôs investment in the common shares while keeping his $5million in preferred shares safe. He would potentially lose the value of any unpaid salary that was converted to stock, but could easily protect himself by doing the conversion after dilution.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Why I like it:\*

I like BBRW because their sales growth YoY is phenomenal, but mostly I like them because after the $15 million in derivative liability reduction due to the merger, their shareholder equity is $949,010 while their market cap is only $622,000. This means it would cost you $622,00 to buy every outstanding share of the company, and if the company were sold that day you‚Äôd be owed $949,010.

Their project sales for 2020 are through the roof. As of yesterday they have taken $3 million in orders already and project to end 2020 with $5 million in orders, compared to $1.5 million last year. They are expanding sales into Mexico, Europe, and Asia and have signed contracts with distributors and importers in those regions. They are also planning to establish a quality management system that allows them to sell their products to pharmaceutical companies and be FDA compliant.

There is an additional COVID play here too. As a business with less than 500 employees, BBRW qualifies for a payroll protection plan which is a loan to be used to pay salaries and rent which represent 92% of the business‚Äôs fixed costs. If they had the PPP last year they would have realized $300,000 in operational profit rather than $594,000 in operational losses. The PPP loan is completely forgiven if they keep everyone employed through the end of the year.

My valuation of this company at the current level of outstanding shares is $0.05 per share, and that‚Äôs fucking harsh. Most other valuations I‚Äôve seen are $0.07. See HokieHead‚Äôs valuations at various levels of share dilution here: [https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=155129763](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=155129763)"	BBRW is Massively Undervalued	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g6yyt5/bbrw_is_massively_undervalued/

     The answer is fidelity because it is free, they don't charge, and you can make the account, add your funds, and trade instantly without any wait period.  

*Other ones (charles shwab) make you wait 3 days before you can buy an OTC stock (DECN). 
*Other ones (TDameritrade) make charge you PER transaction, yes, they literally charge you 6.95$. so thats a big fat no for people only throwing a little money in.

I don't know why nobody literally answered this question, I had to go through rabbit holes opening up accounts etc and talking to customer service to figure it out.

MoltenCare	1587681114	"If you lost money on DECN read this.

I posted an exit strategy on DECN yesterday those of you that followed probably made some money, or at least broke even. No you can argue that Stop losses were the reason for the huge shit it took yada yada yada doesn't matter. Always protect your profits. 

If you were smart you would have seen how big of a panic this sell off was (looks like an inverted exponential curve) and you would know from experience its gonna get a bounce back up. I don't expect you to time the bottom but when you see that last red candle starting to push back up (bottom wick getting longer, red getting smaller) buy back in. Now I don't expect you to exactly hit the peak either. In this case I was off by about another 8 cents potentially missing out on another 25% or so. BUT, I made money and that's what counts.

[Chart 2 RobinTrack Supply/Demand](https://ibb.co/fGLDWSj) 

[Chart 3 Oversold Proof / HODL](https://ibb.co/PwHbrnT)

So much to say about this. Plenty of room for open opportunity to get into. Highly affordable, support has been consistent at 0.25, broke resistance near closing, and after-hours (0.31). The chart has a gap chance for 0.80+. I'd love to truly be intrigued to get into asap confidently to measure a nova breakout around 0.48. Examining the candles on the left chart, we see a high rise of interest peaking since we all know at this point oil/gas is on the rise for demand eventually should the economy re-open again to its normal flow. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is TTI? 

An oil &amp; gas company that focuses on completion fluids and associated products and services, water management, producting well testing, production, offshore rig cooling, &amp; compression services and equipment. 

What's their future? Risk of de-list?

Interestingly enough, the NYSE is being generous extending their continuation multiple times, so I don't see these guys going anywhere. 

Legit company? 

Yes, though slightly struggling they're a renowned necessity as a global business and address/company contact seems to be legit upon doing a little research.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: 

At one point, EPS was consistent on the rise for four quarters.

Cheap.

PB: 1.06 again, another perfect analyst intriguing ratio in trader's eyes.

PE -0.27 (just about right which is a perfect signal for entry).

Oversold.

Refuses to drop bellow 0.25 (support).

Cons:

Q1 2020 resulted in dagger fall in the chart. However, this leads to an open opportunity for a swing trade. 

Debt to asset ratio of 87.20% though not horrible. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's the best entry? 0.30 to 0.25.

Long term or short? Still under observation.

What's your confidence percentage for this? 80% confident."	TTI - Wait for it...	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ga5viz/tti_wait_for_it/

Depending on the OS after dilution, there could be a large variation in target price. Let's say its 100M though, a reasonable price target would be 0.05-0.10/share.

If that sounds like gibberish to you, just know they create custom power solutions for clients that need massive amounts of power, and reliable tech and equipment. They have recently entered a bid for a contract to build a power supply for a direct-energy weapon for a European military contractor, and there are other contracts lined up relating to branches of the US military.

PCTI is going through a reverse merger with the ticker symbol $OZSC. Projected revenues this year are $6m, however more contracts are pending. Their IR firm The Waypoint Refinery has spoken about executing Debt Purchase Agreements this week through their twitter, and through these DPAs, all notes will be frozen for 90 days, stopping dilution and allowing debt to be paid off. Once these are executed, expect a flurry of 1-2 press releases per week about upcoming contracts with military clients and progress on the reverse merger. 
https://twitter.com/WaypointThe 

IN MY OPINION, at 100m-120m outstanding shares (projected SS once dilution ends), the pps can rise to 0.10 at least, without multipliers. Through publicity, competent IR, and additional contracts, the stock could easily see 0.60, and with time, 1.00. Today it closed at 0.013. This is a long play, not just another OTC pump and dump. This company has a footing in the industry, and HUGE clients. That being said, the announcement that the DPAs are executed and dilution is frozen will cause it to gap up BIGLY. 

If this company is familiar to you, you may have been burned by the previous attempt at taking this company public with the ticker $ELTZ. Lots of investors got burned by that shell having a criminally negligent CEO (Terrence Tecco), and a lack of DD by PCTI management that was unfamiliar and naive to the fraudulence of OTC world. That merger fell through, and Brian Conway, CEO of The Waypoint Refinery (IR firm) found OZSC to take PCTI public. This ticker (OZSC) is current, established, not in trips, and the CEO was replaced by Brian Conway, who is handling the IR for PCTI. There are plans in the future to eventually uplist, and Conway's eyes are on NASDAQ. To attract the kind of high-tier investors of whom PCTI is worthy, this is a must. 

PCTI operates in the multi-billion dollar power electronics industry and designs and manufactures leading edge power electronic equipment for use in power conversion. PCTI serves clients in several industries including telecommunications, military, transportation, renewable energy and aerospace. PCTI‚Äôs clients include Fortune 500 companies and government organizations such as the US Military, US Airforce, US Navy and NASA. The global power electronics market size in 2017 was valued at $36 Billion and is expected to reach $51 Billion by 2023 according to MarketsandMarketsTM.

PCTI is also entering the Utility Scale Energy Storage industry. PCTI is well positioned to capitalize on the industry‚Äôs explosive growth by leveraging its expertise and market reputation. The Utility Scale Energy Storage industry is expected to grow tenfold by 2024 to reach $74 Billion according to Wood McKenzie Power &amp; Renewable.

This is not a sexy stock. But it's the real deal. It's a growing company, with 28 yrs experience, military clients, in an exploding industry, and it's going for pennies. All recommendations are in my opinion. But don't miss this one. 

P.S: I don't do this. I'm not the kind of guy to pump stocks on message boards and social media. This is my first time actually posting any DD I have done, however if I'm correct, this stock is going to make a lot of wealthy people. I see it as a sort of public service, plus I never actually organized and documented all the DD collectively, so this is nice.

Bluecyanide1	1588118059	"Hello,

**What stocks will you be expecting to shoot up tomorrow and why?**

I know we currently have the common ones going on this board that everyone is aware of, VISL, UAVS, AYTU, CDEV etc. 

However, GNC went up the other day but that potential was drowned out by everyone talking about the most popular ones (some of which I mentioned above). This is not a bashing post by any means, I just want to hear peoples ideas on any new fresh stocks that they are looking at. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Short and sweet answers, Name and brief reason why you think it'll rise tomorrow.**  (Less jokes preferred, I want this to be a serious quality post so we can hit tomorrow good and make some good profits for everyone!)

ZOM was a good breakout one that happened today but there wasn't much conversation about it before it went up, I'm not sure if that will continue into tomorrow.

When I sent my order the stock jumped down to $0.07 for a split second then jumped right back up. The jump was a little surprising at first but then I noticed my order had filled at $0.70 and I damn near shat myself.

Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA¬Æ device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events (SAEs). The researchers at the Wistar Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) collaborated on this study with funding from IVI. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene &amp; Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference to be held virtually from May 12-15, 2020.

There are several reasons to hold these for 3-6 months while continuing with pennies. The primary reasons I‚Äôm buying are as follows:

1. They‚Äôve already seen high amounts of bookings for 3-6 months out indicating a healthy amount of business already to be expected once quarantine lifts

2. All are currently undervalued due to COVID and are ripe for long term gains

3. The government has already worked out bailout plans to keep airlines alive during the quarantine so they‚Äôre a ‚ÄòToo big to fail‚Äô business now

But primarily 4. Many other governments aren‚Äôt taking the same steps as the United States government in terms of financial protection during thus down time. Due to this many foreign airlines will weaken and go under creating massive expansion opportunities for American Airlines.

My prediction: This thing will crash and burn, and AYTU will get suspended. 

Here's why. First, the science isn't there. Yes, UV light can kill viruses and bacteria on surfaces. And, it can most likely kill the same inside a person's body. However, given that UV light is the leading cause of skin cancer, imagine what it would do to a person's insides? "" ‚ÄúThis treatment sounds like snake oil to me. To insert light inside the body, orally or through the skin, is likely to cause serious damage to blood cells, muscle tissue, organ tissue and DNA.‚Äù - Crispin Halsall, chemist and professor at Lancaster University. ""Quack medicine.""  - Richard Parsons, senior lecturer in biochemical toxicology at King‚Äôs College London. An example of one of many articles on the subject:  [https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-coronavirus-medicine-science-2645823308.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1](https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-coronavirus-medicine-science-2645823308.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1) 

Second, AYTU has recently come under investigation for fraud by at least to security litigation firms - Brock and Leviton and Glancy Prongay &amp; Murray - because of its recent unsubstantiated claims (which is why their videos are getting removed). I wouldn't be surprised if the SEC is also investigating (remember, they were investigating DECN since March but didn't suspend them until a month later).

jus_in_bello	1588090736	"I have seen a lot of rumor and speculation that there is a big announcement from UAVS. This ranges from a contract from AMZN or UPS, to maybe an unknown retailer. However, there is nothing to substantiate these rumors that I could find. 

Yes, there is an investor conference call scheduled for 4/30. But this seems like a regular occurrence (11/11/19, 5/15/19, 3/15/19, 11/14/18, etc). Indeed, the language for the announcement of the conference call mirrors the language for past announcements. Meaning, there is nothing in the announcement itself to indicate any kind of big PR release on Thursday. Further, there has been no insider trading on UAVS, which one would expect if there was some kind of huge PR release imminent.

The hype seems to be driving up the stock (at least yesterday leading up to today), but I don't see any long term reason to hold.  Of course, I'm always happy to be proven wrong."	UAVS and rumors	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g9q7kf/uavs_and_rumors/

After a fire in late 2019, the share price fell from $2.00 to under $1.00. After uncertainty over whether or not they would receive enough proceeds from insurance to rebuild their facility, the price dropped to approximately $0.30. 

The company announced that they will be debt free at the end of 2020 and will be on track for serious growth. Today the stock price reached $0.70 with the news that AQMS has received a large installment from their insurance company.

Cicero1982	1588606858	"Prediction: From 8-13 May there will be a steady uptrend in BIOC Price Action before Earnings are expected after hours on the 13th.

Supporting Evidence:

1. On April 9th 2020 BIOC Biocept reported the following: ‚ÄúOn April 9, 2020, Biocept, Inc. issued a press release announcing that the Company has verified a COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test and plans to begin accepting physician-ordered testing requests for processing beginning on April 15, 2020.‚Äù This news is nearly a month old now and share holders have had no update as to the COVID testing. Therefore investors are still waiting on news of the COVID tests.

Analysis: If their previous report was true news should be coming soon on COVID tests. This will likely be reported during ER. Bulls will want to get in and shorts will want to get out before Friday the 8th. Producing the COVID news should, if positive, launch the share price much higher (from $0.37 to at minimum $0.55 [likely much higher])

2. The three offerings in the last two months are still fresh on the minds of shareholders, and are why this security is still trading low.

Analysis: Why is this supporting evidence? The three recent offerings likely mean that they have plenty of funding. They announced over a month ago that they had enough funding until Q1 2021. They should now have much more than that. This will be reported during ER and bulls will likely give them a boost with the knowledge that they won‚Äôt need to raise money for a while (NOTE: History has shown that they raise money frequently so don‚Äôt count on them forgoing an offering if a significant catalyst is in play). Moreover there is a low to moderate chance that the most recent offerings were released with the knowledge that future news of their COVID-19 testing will bump up their share price at ER. 

Note: I‚Äôm Not Worried About a Reverse Split Until After June 5th:

Analysis: Sure they could have been in compliance had they not tanked their own stock three times in two months but fortunately they are putting the reverse split decision to the shareholders on  June 5th 2020. BIOC must be in compliance by June 30th 2020. So there is no immediate threat to shareholders of a R/S before June 5th. 

3. The EU has given BIOC the thumbs up on their Target Selector kits. The status of this will also likely be reported at ER. There relevant press release stated the following: ‚ÄúThe CE Mark confirms that the Target Selector kit products meet the requirements of the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive and allows Biocept to commercialize its kits throughout the European Union and other CE Mark geographies‚Äù

Analysis: A positive update on the Target Selector Kits will likely give BIOC a solid boost during ER. Particularly if they get help in marketing them. Bulls will be looking for this at ER. 

Conclusion: There is plenty here to drive the shorts out and bring the bulls in to $BIOC after Friday the 8th of May. The chance that there will be a steady uptrend in BIOC Price Action before Earnings on the 13th is therefore probable.

In Case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In Case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.

trevandezz	1588589977	If you watched my vod in post history about MVIS, I was planning on selling TTI near end of day today and moving into MVIS and riding the wave up til Thursday. But $0.62 was my target for Thursday on MVIS and I missed the move. No worries though! So the MVIS trade is a no-go for me now unless we see a dip that looks tasty to buy into. Currently, exiting my TTI position at some point soon ($0.39 if it goes down and $0.70 if it goes up) is my only plan for this week. I can‚Äôt tell you what to do if you‚Äôre holding MVIS but me personally, I‚Äôd just take that 70% profit and be done trading for the week. Not financial advice though.

I've opened my first ever trading account(s) and am hoping to use the pandemic as an opportunity to get started in investing.  Apart from my DoD TSP, which is temporarily in government securities, I am looking at some long term holds as well as trying to play some short term profits on these volatile rallys/pumps.  I know little to nothing about trading, so please go easy on me.

Anyway, my reason for posting - Luvu brands (LUVU).  They were stuck around a penny up until early 2020 before seeing some growth, then crashed with the rest of the market.  Surprisingly, over the last few weeks the stock has gone from around $.05 to a peak of $.19.  This past week it dropped back around $.13. They are known for Liberator, the popular sex pillow/furniture brand but recently pivoted to manufacture face masks as well.  Kinda comical to consider, a bunch of people trapped inside must be passing the time by making quarantine babies. üòâ  But have all the interested buyers made their purchases already, and their sales will taper off?  Or is the stock growing because of face mask production?

Should I wait for it to drop back down to around $.05?  Ignore it?  Or buy in now and see where it goes?  Thoughts/opinions?  Wanted to share a stock that I (a COMPLETE noob to trading) think might be a winner.  But I would like some outside opinions.  Thanks."	Total Noob Here, First Post - Luvu Brands?

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE‚Äôs and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

I figure that with the 30+ day lock down that NY and other states have faced, there are a lot of miss parties and celebrations that people have been aching to get into. To me, that means Party City (PRTY).

Now the second reason that PRTY is a hot stock for me is, and this is stupid but try, PRTY is a cool stock symbol and those seem to bring the investors at strange times. I know it's stupid but that's just what it is. Once people can PRTY again this summer, those investors will be pushing the price.

**Disclaimers: I am not a finance professional. I am not making any recommendations to I purchase, not purchase, sell, or otherwise trade in this security or any type of security. I am not claiming to have presented all information in this post, you should do your own research and make your own decisions before trading. I am a novice with written up DD, constructive feedback is welcomed and appreciated.**

**I CURRENTLY HOLD BBRW STOCK:**

https://preview.redd.it/atge5qjjnkw41.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fa6b029fca9a5de4c0b2af2785942dd48589d3d

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview of BBRW:** BrewBilt Manufacturing Inc. is a California-based manufacturer of fermentation and distillation equipment for craft beer, cannabis, and hemp industries. BBRW was incorporated in 2014. They pride themselves on using ""Best in Class American made components integrated with stainless steel processing vessels using only American made steel"" (10K).

BrewBilt has traditionally targeted the craft beer industry, a $26B market in the United States. Since 2014, craft beer production in the United States has grown in sales by 5.7%. Through 2018, the number of active businesses in the craft beer industry has grown by 14.1%.

BrewBilt cites competitors as those who mostly buy and resell cheaper product from China.

In November of 2019, BBRW acquired VetOnlineSupply, a company that sells CBD-infused pet products. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financials:**

At the year ended December 31,2019, BBRW had total liabilities of $6,810,483 ($2,273,269 of which is derivative from the merger with VOS) up from $2,663,114 the year prior. 

Total assets for 2019 were $949,010, down from $1,636,991 in 2018.

Gross profit from sales in 2019 was $380,387, down from $410,141 in 2018.

Total cash at the end of 2019 was $1,444, down from $43,285 in 2018.

BBRW's total shareholder equity is $949,010 but the market cap is only **around $320,000**. As u/ShitPostGuy pointed out, that means that you can buy all the outstanding stock for $622,000, and if the company were sold that day you'd be owed $949,010.

To note: BBRW deferred the revenue and related cost of sales in the sum of $1,511,096 and $1,905,346 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, in revenue, and $$53,038 and $344,134 in cost of sales, respectively. This is due typically to orders being placed in one year and fulfilled in the next. 

To note, a direct quote from the 10K: ""The Company has experienced net losses to date, and it has not generated sufficient revenue from operations to meet our operational overhead. We will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a growing concern. Management of the company is preparing a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long-term financing or debt financing, to enable the Company to reach profitable operations. Historically, the Company's sole officer and director has provided short term loans to meet working capital shortfalls. We have recently entered into financing agreements with various third parties to meet our capital needs in fiscal 2020.""

Another important thing to note: Management has concluded that during FY 2018-2019, the internal accounting and financials procedures were not effective, but maintain and that there was no fraud. Since they are strapped for cash, ""we are not able to, and do not intend to, immediately take any action to remediate these material weaknesses....Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that our financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2019, fairly represents our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods covered.""

As of December 31, 2019, 5,000,000,000 shares of common stock were authorized, of which 10,343,330 shares issued and outstanding. 

**Upshot:** To me, the financials reflect pretty standard small-business startup situations: operating at a loss until they make enough money to cover their expenses. BBRW has the potential to fuck over any common stock investor and issuing a couple billion shares of stock, which would demolish anyone's holdings, or CEO P&amp;D that we saw most recently with UAVS. That, and they never escape the financial hole they're in and go under.

BBRW is currently projected to end this year with around $5 million in orders, which I don't need to tell you is significantly more than the $1.5 million from lat year. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My view:** as you can see, I lost about half of my investment so far in BBRW, but in all honesty I'll probably be buying more since its so cheap. I do believe that this is an actual longer term investment stock, not a momentum rider where you can make a quick buck in a few days. I'll probably get in another 10k shares. I like the way the market sector is growing, I like the way they've diversified via the merger. The recent price drop has made this a great time to get into this stock, I believe.

It may not be in your best interest to take investment advice from unvetted strangers on the internet."	BBRW DD	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcug5a/bbrw_dd/

Here are some scientific facts:
UV Light:
UV light can be categorized into A, B or C. With UV-C being the highest energy (shorter wavelength) and UV-A being the lowest energy (longest wave length). UV causes damage to cells because DNA absorbs the photons that cause DNA mutation called Thymine Dimers. This DNA damage leads to an inability to express genes or a over expression; the point being cells don‚Äôt function correctly and or in some cases become cancerous. BUT, certain narrow wavelengths of UV function as therapeutics, for say psoriasis as an examlple. While the mechanism isn‚Äôt completely understood (as are many things in science medicine), it effectively destroys those cells affected by psoriasis while preserving normals cells and not causing off target mutations. 

Theory behind UV-A in Healight: 
If I were to use my background in science I would hypothesize that a very narrow band of UV-A light has been shown to destroy bacterial and viral cells while not harming mammalian cells. Mammalian cells are enormous in comparison to viruses, the are protected by think cell walls, their interiors are filled with organelles(Golgi mitochondria etc.) and its nucleus is covered in an additional protective membrane. The Coronavirus in comparison are less complex, a simple lipid bilayer  and nuclear capsid protect the single stranded RNA (if my memory serves me right). It is then feasible that UV-A will effect the smaller viral cells to a much larger extent than mammalian cells. 
Let me guarantee that no medical doctor or translational research scientist would ever claim a technology worked without substantial scientific evidence to back it up. We as the general public are not privy to their experimental data until it gets peer-reviewed, meaning non-partial scientist closely scrutinize your protocol and every piece of data before giving it the ok. From a science stand point there is nothing that tells me this technology is bogus or not feasible. In my opinion it has potential and am going to hold until I see the literature or hear from the FDA

In today‚Äôs age of technology information is passed around the world in a matter of seconds. An easy strategy for penny stocks is to scour through several different platforms looking for the same stock to be talked about across all the platforms. If a stock is being hyped up on all different platforms it is likely to rise, at least temporarily, simply due to the hype it has online. The key with this is to be sure you get out of the stock extremely quick and never become a bag holder based simply off of random internet users opinion and hype. 

I know this is probably a very unpopular opinion in the stock world because it‚Äôs well known that you should do you own DD before investing but in terms of making a **quick profit on penny stocks** this strategy could actually be useful.

realaxing	1588515756	"Trading stocks, you have to operate on some core principles, otherwise you'll be sloppy and you'll lose money everywhere with your only gains being on mistake. A good core ideal to have is that the market knows everything you know, and has calculated these things into it's price already.

Now sometimes, there's some niche information out there and only the big boys at the top who take the %10 of winning trades know. That's called alpha. Alpha is anything that the market price hasn't yet accounted for. Now, this is hard to find and usually, can only be found in person, through physically investigative means or from some drop box link that you really weren't supposed to find. Getting actual, solid alpha is incredibly profitable because you know something is going down and can bet on it months in advance; but as profitable as it is, it's rare. 

So what can \*you\* do? You can still do your due diligence and at least trade with the same level of knowledge the market moves at and make your own determinations of it based on your interpretation of the data. A good place to start is with the company's 10-k and 10-k/a filings. The 10-k gives you an overview of every single Asset, Liability, Risk, and Executive within a company, with the 10-k/a giving an overview of the executive structure. These two forms, although boring as all hell, contain a plethora of knowledge crucial to making a smart move on the market. You can find these by googling (stock symbol) ""sec filings""

Internet forums, online trading gurus, and people who have a dad working at dronetendo aren't people to listen to for trading ideas. Make your own trading ideas. Don't get swept up in someone's pump-and-dump model. Have a good idea, find a stock you like to fit that idea, do your homework, and invest. That's how the market makes money. Hold onto an investment for a month to three months, and take out substantially more stable, viable earnings."

DilanthaDD94	1588488336	"Hello all,

There has been a lot of hype about CYDY in the last couple of months. No surprise because the company has made some actual progress in developing a cure for Covid-19. Shares are up 220% since the beginning of the year, and on April 30, CYDY announced some good results in its trials. 

But, the CEO has sold more than 4 million shares on April 30. A normal Edgar search won't show you that because this was filed in a Form-144. I think most of the positive news is already factored in now. It would take the company commercializing a product to trigger another bull run as far as I see.

PradoMV96	1588460163	"**APPS, also known as Digital Turbine**, is a company that works at the convergence of media and mobile communications, delivering end-to-end products and solutions for mobile operators, device OEMs and other third parties to enable them to effectively monetize mobile content. 

Essentially what Digital Turbine does is [this](https://www.digitalturbine.com/about/):  They makes it easier than ever for people to frictionlessly discover new apps, for operators and OEMs to build new revenue streams, and for advertisers to reach users at scale.

The past three quarters have [proved to show consistently strong numbers](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/apps/financials), quarter after quarter and year after year. This past earnings call for their most recent quarter was posted back in February on the 10th. Their third quarter revenue was $36 Million which is the company's **all time** high revenue and it shows an **18% growth** when compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2019. 

Even better, they reported a $12.5 Million **growth** in their cash balance and they reported **ZERO DEBT.**  [Here is the DD on what i have said in terms to their growth and zero debt report.](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/press-releases/detail/589/digital-turbine-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results)

Not only did Digital Turbine post incredibly positive earnings, reporting their all time high revenue, they also confirmed an acquisition. APPS purchased ""Mobile Posse"" for a reported $66 Million. This is incredibly well done business for multiple reasons.

*  They achieved 2019 revenue of $59.1 million, a GAAP Net Income of $4.5 million and a Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 million 
* They have reported rapid revenue and profitability growth over the past 5+ years 
* They  have a highly profitable, recurring business model with gross margins approaching 50% and EBITDA margins in excess of 20% 
* The acquisition of Mobile Posse brings Digital Turbine **strategic partners which are Tmobile and Metro PCS**

The best part of everything i have just mentioned is that it will be reflected during their next earnings call which is on [June 1st](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/apps/earnings). Here is all the [DD on everything i had just mentioned regarding APPS acquisition of Mobile Posse.](https://content.equisolve.net/_dd96bc3559702235d3af3b6271f3a98c/digitalturbine/db/199/1884/pdf/Mobile+Posse+Investor+Summary+FINAL.pdf)

Another thing that has flown under the radar that they have recently done is this: [On February 10th](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/press-releases/detail/589/digital-turbine-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results), Digital Turbine announced their new Global distribution with LG Electronics. This is huge deal for APPS, it'll definitely be reflected upon their next earnings call and all i can see from this distribution partnership is an increase in revenue. The distribution partnership plus the acquisition of Mobile Posse, all this will do is increase their revenue by a ton. It's amazing news, but yet both of these have gone under the radar.

**Target Prices &amp; forecasts:**

* After everything i have just mentioned, canaccord genuity  analyst Andrew Moldow increased Digital Turbine's [target price](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-digital-turbine-stock-jumped-wednesday-2020-03-04) from $8 to $12 dollars.
* Finviz currently sets APPS [target price](https://www2.finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APPS&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d) to $10
* CNN money currently has [6 analysts offering a price forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=APPS) for Digital Turbine Inc at a median price target of $10.00, with a high estimate of $12.00 and a low estimate of $7

**My final thoughts and comments on this stock/company:**

* I personally have invested $1000 into APPS, i bought 262 shares a month ago on April 2nd when i first began hearing about this company.
* I have also bought several long calls a month ago that have already been raking in profits for me as well. 
* I genuinely do believe that they will reach $10-15 by the end of the year. I believe so because of all their recent acquisitions and partnerships they have made, plus they have zero debt and they reported their highest ever revenue the previous quarter.
* They are so close to $7 dollars, which is CNNs lowest estimate price target, which again adds to why i believe they will reach past the $10 mark

At the end of the day, this is just thorough research on APPS. What you decide to do, whether purchase or not. Or if you do decide to purchase and you buy a little or a lot, thats all on you. Like I tell everyone, Please do your own DD as well before you ever hit submit when purchase a stock or an option.

Please read the articles and links i have clipped into this DD so you can have all the knowledge possible to make a well informed decision.

view-from-afar	1588438225	"First is MVIS' interactive display.  Here it is [being demonstrated at CES 2020 where it won an award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcVeSz4c7io).

It is a MEMS laser scanning projector with lidar (3D sensing) built in.  Both the projector and lidar use the same MEMS mirror.  To project the image, a MEMS mirror scans an always in focus beam of light generated by just 3 laser diodes (RGB).  The beam of light is rastered back and forth at incredible speed over a field of view.

To make the image interactive using lidar, a 4th laser diode (invisible IR) is added to the RGB beam along with a single photodetector.  All 4 scanned are by the MEMS mirror into the desired field of view.

This product was expected to be launched in 2020 by a Tier 1 OEM, believed to be Amazon.  On February 25, 2020, MVIS announced that the OEM decided not to launch in 2020 for unstated reasons.  Considering the Covid-19 lockdowns that followed immediately, it seems likely that the delay/cancellation was related.  Regardless, the company was forced to cut staff and explore other strategic alternatives and sources of cash for 2020.  The share price crashed immediately to all-time lows.

The video above includes discussions of other current and near term applications of MVIS MEMS scanning technology, including consumer lidar and automotive lidar.  These are described elsewhere as best in class in terms of range, resolution, lack of motion blur, ability to zoom in and out, etc.

They do not talk about AR or Hololens 2, likely due to NDA restrictions.

The video does not mention another MVIS product, an even tinier 720p laser projector based on the same technology that can be embedded into a smartphone.  It was launched in a 3rd tier Chinese smartphone in 2017, the [Voga V](https://www.google.ca/search?q=voga+v&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03PbQ7Ve5y4wsGKwJWy5aUfm_P2VQ:1588437576405&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi42vSLz5XpAhXHbc0KHSsrCFkQ_AUoA3oECAwQBQ&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=554).  The [projector received excellent reviews](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/voga-v) but the phone was substandard and failed.   Here it is [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aknykPZykeQ)

Look at the size of the image at time 2:30 and on.  For reasons beyond my grasp, the major phone OEMS have not yet incorporated the technology though their patents often refer to it.

MVIS reported in 2018 that its new MEMS scanner and ASICs provide resolution up to 1440p at 120Hz.  It is believed that this scanner is driving the Hololens 2 display. 

Note, all scan lines in videos are not visible in person.  They are a result of the refresh rates of the camera and projector not being synchronized.

My opinion:  this company is a diamond in the rough with a depressed share price due to current circumstances (including facing a reverse split due to being below the Nasdaq minimum $1 bid price) and a very long (25 year) history of slow but steady technology development at the incredible cost of $600M-$1B which has worn down generations of now exhausted shareholders.  It is facing short term cash needs and market disruptions aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic. 

FULL DISCLOSURE:  I am one of those long term shareholders, so I am obviously interested in the share price rising.  Therefore, read this with that in mind."

It's now time to take action and help build a grass-roots campaign to help GenViro! get through FDA approval.  My proposal is simple..

 Take to Social Media and post responses to Governors and reporters issuing updates regarding #Coronovirus and #COVID-19 testing letting them, and everyone else engaged on their post, know that there's an at home, $10 finger-prick test capable of delivering results in 15 seconds, and instead of being made widely available, it's collecting dust on someone's desk collecting dust due to the incompetence of the FDA.

My theory is, when the public at large hears of this, the Governors will have no choice but to start leaning on POTUS to help get this product pushed through ASAP, especially when the public understands that this is how you issue your nasal swab test: [https://imgur.com/w6UfbAe](https://imgur.com/w6UfbAe)

Hey guys, it's Flynn. Today I wanted to talk about Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc (DFFN). DFFN is currently trading to 0.5120 cents per share and has a market cap of 17.717 million dollars. DFFN is a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops treatments for life threatening medical conditions and is based in Charlottesville, Virginia. On April 1st DFFN announced that they have agreed to team up with UVA Health and iTHRIV to team up against ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) which is a symptom associated with the COVID-19 virus. After the announcement of the forming of a coalition share prices skyrocketed from $.30 per share to 0.75 cents per share then made its way back down to .40 cents per share. Later in the month DFFN announced their pre-IND submission After the news of this broke share prices rose from .45 cents per share to 0.85 cents per share. I believe if the FDA grants permission to DFFN I believe history will repeat itself and follow the same result. One thing I would like to point out is that they are at risk of being delisted because they are currently being traded at under a dollar per share. A reverse split is also a potential possibility trying to raise share prices to avoid being delisted and they have till August 24, 2020 to regain compliance. I believe this stock could have some good opportunities to make money but remember bulls make money, bears make money and pigs get slaughtered. So in my opinion I think make out with profit while you can and ride the waves."	DFFN Research	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gc8cc5/dffn_research/

mtmtrader	1588432618	"Penny stocks get a bad reputation in the stock market, rightfully so, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad to trade. Most people actually start of trading penny stocks as opposed to what are known as *""blue chip stocks.""* Like anything else, there are pros and cons to each. I wanted to share this post to talk about some of the misconceptions of penny stocks, and explain why I personally focus on them with my own day trading.

First, **what even is a penny stock?** No... penny stocks are not just stocks worth a single penny and no they're not just stocks worth less than $1.00. By definition, any stock priced below $5.00 per share is considered a penny stock.

Penny stocks are priced low for a reason. They're *usually* the stock of a lesser-know company with not-so-reliable reputation to their shareholders. That's why they have such a bad reputation in general, and is why a lot of people think trading penny stocks is pure gambling. At the end of the day, penny stocks offer day traders a lot more than most blue chip stocks offer.

A **blue chip stock** is the stock of a huge company with a great reputation. These are stocks like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG), Facebook ($FB), etc... basically ""household name"" companies. Although these seem like the better investment options, they're not necessarily going to be the better option for an average trader.

**Penny Stock Pros:**

**Higher Volatility:** Penny stocks generally have much higher volatility than blue chip stocks, making them more high risk, high reward. A certain amount of volatility is needed for day trading! Without it there is not enough price movement to be able to get in and out of positions within the day like day traders do. The high volatility in the penny stock market is the reason traders are able to make 10%, 20%, even 50% or more in a single day... a *very* rare occurrence in the blue chip market.

**Less Money Needed:** With penny stocks you may be able to buy 1,000s of shares at a time with a small account when you'd only be able to buy a few shares of a blue chip stock. With that being said, penny stocks are usually looked at as the much better option for new traders with limited capital to start trading. In fact, that why most new traders do end up starting with penny stocks, which leads me to the third ""pro.""

**Less ""Competition"":** Your competition in the stock market is every single other buyer and seller. Everyone is competing against each other to get the best prices and to buy low and sell high for a profit. When one person loses money, another gains! *So..*. would you rather be competing against multi-billion dollar funds and investment firms in the blue chip market, or a herd on new traders with little-to-no experience in the penny stock market? Now that's not to say there aren't still investment firms and algorithmic trading taking place in the penny stock market, but it is less common than it is in the blue chip market.

**Penny Stock Cons:**

**Higher Volatility:** A double-edged sword. As I already mentioned above, the higher volatility of the penny stock market can definitely be a big benefit, but if you're not careful it can also cause larger losses than you would experience with less volatility. This is why risk management and proper position sizing is crucial, especially when trading stocks with high volatility.

**Less Volume:** This is one of the concerns that most traders bring up when they talk about why they don't trade penny stocks. In my opinion, this doesn't make much sense as a ""con"" just for penny stocks, because there are plenty blue chip stocks with low liquidity and volume as well. As day traders, we have to adapt to the market on a daily basis. This means finding the stocks making larger-than-average moves with high relative volume and, usually, news or a press release to go along. Volume is only an issue with day trading penny stocks if you're choosing the wrong penny stocks to day trade.

**Low-Quality Companies:** Again, penny stocks are priced low for a reason. If they were multi-billion dollar companies with years of growing profitability, their stock price would reflect that. It's important to trade the stock, don't fall in love with it! You don't want to invest in a penny stock long-term, because the odds of you picking the next Amazon of Apple are slim to none. Instead, take advantage of the increase volatility brought by the penny stock market for day trading and look to the more reliable blue chip market for your swing trades longer-term investments.

As you can see, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider before diving into the penny stock market to start day trading. If you have the discipline to manage risk properly then they can be a great option to grow a small trading account in a short period of time. *Otherwise,* you may want to take things a bit more slowly by focussing your trading on less volatile, more stable blue chip stocks.

PradoMV96	1588372633	"TTI, also known as Tetra Technologies. They're known for being a diverse gas &amp; oil company. They conduct business globally &amp; conduct business in 6 different continents. 
Anyways, their business is cut up in three different divisions, hence why they're known for being diverse in this space. Those three divisions are: 1. Completion Fluids and Products 2.Water and Flowback Services  3. Compression.

Here's why they've been on the news and on people's mind lately. 
*They're headquartered in Texas
*Texas is one of the first States in the USA to begin reopening businesses.
*They have a earnings call this coming week.

You put all those three together &amp; you get hype and momentum behind this stock/company.

Now let's have a look at their financials for Q1 &amp; upcoming Q2 of this year.
- As stated from one of their news announcements back in in April 1st that went under the radar, [TTI Announced](http://ir.tetratec.com/2020-04-01-TETRA-Technologies-Inc-Receives-Continued-Listing-Standard-Notice-From-NYSE-And-Provides-Update-To-Address-The-Industry-Downturn) ""TETRA was also recently awarded two significant high-value completion fluids projects. The first one is a multi-well deepwater¬†Gulf of Mexico¬†project for a supermajor oil company and the second one is a multi-year¬†Middle East¬†project for a major National Oil Company. Both of these projects will start in the second quarter of this year.¬†""

These two high valued contracts will definitely be reflected upon earnings call this week on May 5th. This goes along the upward trend they've experienced from the previous quarter

As stated in their recent announcement this past month, their 4th quarter revenue jumped [5 percent compared to the 3rd quarter of last year](http://ir.tetratec.com/2020-02-27-TETRA-Technologies-Inc-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-And-Full-Year-2019-Results)

This Jump in revenue for the 4th quarter is directly related to new technology and advancement in their tech. Here, I will provide evidence to support my claim. In the previous quarter, they announced ""Sandstorm"" and demonstrated that it's sand removal technologies is 95% efficient compared to traditional sand removal technologies that only operates at roughly 50% efficiency. After this demonstration of their **new and patented technology** they received a large servicing contract for the Permian Basin.

The best part about then receiving this contract is that it has been deployed during the first quarter of this year. 
This is big because it has gone hugely under the radar and I haven't seen anyone mention their new technology nor this contract they received and will be implemented within their first quarter earnings.

Here's my [DD](https://pasteboard.co/J6owYBb.png) on all that I mentioned above. 

Back on April 1st, Tetra received notice that they've been trading under $1.00 for 30 consecutive days which could result in a delisting from the NYSE. To counteract that, Tetra have been given 6 months from the date of their notice to reach share value of $1.00 or higher. Tetra themselves have notified the NYSE of their intent to cure the deficiency and to return to a share value of $1 or higher. As I've mentioned earlier, they've received [Two high value contracts](http://ir.tetratec.com/2020-04-01-TETRA-Technologies-Inc-Receives-Continued-Listing-Standard-Notice-From-NYSE-And-Provides-Update-To-Address-The-Industry-Downturn#) to alleviate their deficiency. Because of this, they claim that they will outperform the next two quarters.

Forecasts: [As stated on the NASDAQ website](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tti/analyst-research) Analysts believe that The average price target is¬†$1.13¬†with a high estimate of¬†$1.25¬†and a low estimate of¬†$1. 

Tetra themselves have a [target price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TTI) of **$1.08**

Now my personal thoughts and opinions (please do not take this as a fact and please as I always mention, do your own DD to make sure you feel comfy with whatever you decide to invest in).

I believe this stock will reach $1. As analysts say, they have a low estimate of a dollar whereas TTIs own target price is at 1.08. I feel they will gradually go up. 

Will they moon this coming week after earnings call? I don't know, no one else will know that either lol. But I do believe they rise.

Like I've mentioned with the previous VISL stock, theyre a relatively low priced stock. The volume isn't crazy high. It's only 2M above their average volume. And by simply looking at the charts, their price tends to go up with a surge of volume. I feel it's worth investing a bit into it.

How much should you invest? I don't know. It's upto you. If you ask me how much I've invested, I bought 100 shares when it was at .37 and I'll keep holding through the earnings call.

Best of luck to everyone! Hope my DD helped out."	DD on Tetra Technologies TTI	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbs1p1/dd_on_tetra_technologies_tti/

This chart shows the massive short squeeze that the whale who did the stop hunt created on the MVIS 10d:30m chart. And guess what? The squeeze should breakout just before the end of day! The market player who did that squeeze is actually giga brain and I predict that this will shoot up before the end of the day because of it. Then again I'm a huge amateur, and I could be dead wrong.

muranogrl95	1588873162	"Euro sun mining is a stock that I‚Äôve been holding for a while. It‚Äôs a junior gold mine company that has a huge upside potential and has been reviewed recently by many analysts as buy and hold long. It‚Äôs extremely undervalued and has been steadily climbing at 3-5-15% daily.   I found this stock because I‚Äôm a big fan of business man Stan Bhartti. He has an amazing  track record of turning publicly traded companies into gold (pun intended). He now runs a Fortune 500 styled company (Forbes and Manhattan) out of Toronto and ESM is one of his chosen companies to invest in and take to its full potential. 
The increase in gold and market volatility from covid make buying gold and gold mining stocks a smart investment. I‚Äôm excited about this one and I‚Äôm in no way saying that you should run out and buy this stock. Maybe do some DD though and maybe you‚Äôll like what you see about this company.   There‚Äôs no rocket ships in this post or ‚Äúto the moon and back‚Äù. This stock is a sound investment that will make you money in the short term and the long term.

D1ld0swagg1nz	1588867874	"After my own short DD I decided to hop in at 3K shares, considering to double down now. Saw some interesting DD on it, one that explains the recent drop (link below) and one that explains why their stock should shortly tremendously increase in value. In contrast to MVIS and IZEA they have a very strong balance sheet and are still very low to buy into. Their new drug should bring in at least 20 million, and giving their market cap of 28 million this should really boost the company long term. Seeing that people are only now starting to realize this we should be looking at a price of 0.73$ at least, while they're right now still trading at only .36$.

This may be one of the investments I make where it went from a speculative short term buy into a long haul hold.

fufufang	1588857868	"I am blown away by the support I received from my last post. I received 5 awards. I know it has only been about 12 hours since I last posted, considering the fast moving nature of the market, I decided to post this right before NASDAQ open. 

I won't have time to implement new ideas and suggestions until weekend, so the same thing will be manually posted on Friday. 

I will also set the script to monitor more subreddits. I am thinking of cross-referencing trade volumes and prices using Google finances. Any ideas and suggestions are welcome. I don't promise to implement your ideas and suggestions, it all depends on my time availability and the task difficulty. 

Next week I will probably start AUTOMATICALLY posting it in my own subreddit or something.  The reason for posting in my own subreddit is because I think it might be useful for people to look at historic data. Not having other threads cluttering things up might be helpful. I will be monitoring more than 1 subreddit. I will also be looking for moderator for my new subreddits, as I am not good with technology, so I need help. I am not making any promise at this stage yet, I am just gathering potential help that I need down the line. 

I don't know if my bot would be welcomed here. Mod, if you want my future bot to post here, please make a mod comment. 

Anyways, the next update will be around 8/May 1400 BST. Your OP is living in England, this is why I use BST. The reason I post around 1400 BST is because my stocks are in NASDAQ. (Damn you, NASDAQ: MVIS)

toothbrush6969	1588854872	"What do you guys think about adding new user flairs to this sub? They would be only applied to users by the mods.

I‚Äôm open to suggestions but what I have in mind is 2 different types of flairs. I prefer the second type

First type: the flair would say how many pennystocks they‚Äôve accurately called out before the spikes. For example, if someone called out IZEA and MVIS before their spikes then they‚Äôd have a ‚Äò2‚Äô flair next to their name 

Second type: the flair would say how experienced / reputable the user is. For example, everyone starts off with either none or a ‚Äòbeginner‚Äô or ‚Äònoob‚Äô flair. Then after 5 accurate call outs they get upgraded to ‚Äòintermediate‚Äô. Then after 10 call outs they get upgraded to ‚Äòadvanced‚Äô. Then after 20 call outs they get upgraded to ‚Äòexpert‚Äô. Again, these are just suggestions and I expect you guys to make changes to these.

The reasoning behind this is to help this sub somewhat differentiate between credible posts and posts we should be weary of. A lot of us, me included, are beginners. We don‚Äôt know how to find penny stocks before they blow up and we usually just hop on the train midway through. There‚Äôs dozens of different stocks posted daily and it‚Äôll help narrow down credible ones quicker (where we‚Äôll then do our own DD). We also don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs advice to take when we have 20 different people saying 20 different things. If I have 3 ‚Äòadvanced‚Äô people telling me to dump a stock and 10 ‚Äònoob‚Äô people telling me to hold, Id likely be more inclined to dump.

The only downside that I can think of is that an advanced / expert user could try and abuse that status to pump a stock just to save themselves.

mikeman442	1588854794	"$SGMD America Prepares to Reopen and Needs Sanitary and Non-Medical Personal Protective Supplies - Sugarmade Received $10 million 

NEW YORK, NY -- May 6, 2020 -- InvestorsHub NewsWire -- Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCQB:SGMD) (""Sugarmade"", ""SGMD"", or the ""Company""), today announces the receipt of over $10 million in new orders for consumable sanitary supplies and non-medical personal protective items, as America prepares to get back to work. Businesses across the country that are preparing to reopen face both the moral and legal obligations to protect their workers and customers. Many are scrambling for supplies as part of this re-opening process. Sugarmade's CarryOutsupplies.com operating unit is benefiting via receiving purchase orders in excess of $10 million. 



""We have never seen anything like this situation. We believe we are in a unique situation relative to the re-opening of America,"" commented Jimmy Chan, CEO of Sugarmade. ""Approximately two months ago we began importing consumable sanitary supplies and non-medical personal protective gear. As it turns out, this was a wise move. We sold out of nearly all of what we received. Fortunately, we have the sourcing and trans-Pacific logistical experience to bring in much larger quantities to help meet the insatiable demand that is developing as business, universities, and government institutions order supplies to protect their workers and customers. We have a lot more product in the supply chain that will soon be headed to our customers."" 



Over the past 15 years of operations Sugarmade has gained considerable experience relative to sourcing paper and consumable products from Asian factories and importing these products into the United States. The Company has drawn on these experiences and industry contacts to identify multiple factory sources that indicate a willingness to supply millions of dollars of products to Sugarmade. By way of this experience, the Company believes it will be able to facilitate the movement of the huge amounts of supplies that companies and government entities are now demanding as they begin to execute plans to re-start operations. 



Mr. Chan continued, ""America is getting back to work and we are here to help with many of the supplies businesses and other institutions are demanding. We are quickly expanding our sourcing and importing efforts to help U.S. businesses and other institutions protect their employee and provide safe working environments. While the gating factor in filling these orders, over the short term, will be the availability of air freight, we also believe we are well position relative to the longer-term as our considerable experience in trans-Pacific logistics is brought to bear."" 



Investors, the public, and other interested parties are advised to reference the Company's recent filing with the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission on Form 8-K concerning these events and to reference other disclosures and risk factors outlined in other filings put forth by the Company, which are available on the Commission's website and via other resources.

&amp;#x200B;

Graphical Analysis; 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ayh2vqep14y41.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e0b9f1f8a6f38935a4e57f0fc1f0cc359dc5fd

There a few bullish moving average signals. The 8 day SMA (green line) has just crossed the 200SMA (blue line). The 20 day EMA (pink line) has crossed the 50 day SMA (yellow) and looks on course to cross the 200SMA as long as we say movements to the upside running up the merger.

&amp;#x200B;

Technical Analysis 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ieeuo1p924y41.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5c2fe6bbb91f5c61caaa6d6fd38b8019e01d82a

Green line indicating a positive trend, red negative and white the strength of the trend.  Bare in mind that when the white line is over the range 20-25 this indicates a strong trend so there are signs of a strong positive trend here. Will be monitoring the ADX in case of the line creeping into the higher regions.

OBV is showing that more people than ever are accumulating the stock in the last week than at any other point - 448.25m

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xplxmsws34y41.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f7fbe62834c30487a08416eee910f53872f10cc

&amp;#x200B;

Stochastics are in the 40-50 region with a downward bias and RSI flirting around 50-60 region. As long as RSI maintains this region and doesn't push into the overbought area I will expect to see some more bullish sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

MACD histogram showing an increase in buyer volume (as expected) with the signal and MACD line cross over occuring over a month ago on the daily timeframe. The lines are far apart and will expect to see further divergence of these lines in the upcoming week.

This is the first time that I make a post here but first of all a big thank you to everyone that adds value to the PennyStocks with analysis, posts and comments. Thank You.

So, I am a little undecided in which stocks I should go for the coming weeks. 

I was thinking in those:

* AYTU
* PRTY
* AIM
* ONTX
* TTI

Can I have your opinion about them? Or do you recommend another ones?

apple_n1	1589162135	"**Analysis**

[Looking at the chart we see that the price is trading at $0.454. It is seen that price has recently broken the resistance at $0.370 turning it into support. The new resistance is at $0.651. The upward rally started after the formation of morning star pattern which is bullish reversal pattern indicating upward movement. ](https://preview.redd.it/6pjs1hdzh1y41.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d86c34c5796b2de1d687f32711a29e4d8744a33)

**DOW THEORY**

[According to Dow Theory the Coin is currently seen in the accumulation phase it is a phase in which investors \\""in the know\\"" are actively buying stock against the general opinion of the market. During this phase, the stock price does not change much because these investors are in the minority demanding stock that the market at large is supplying. This phase is followed by the public participation phase in which public starts actively taking positions and upward rally is seen.](https://preview.redd.it/y19933vei1y41.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df789dda1c4202b4586c8abd51424cc1e4f6de2a)

**Bollinger Bands** 

[The price was moving between the channels with the upper limit acting as resistance and the lower limit acting as support. It is seen that the channel is expanding and the price has broken the upper limit with positive momentum which indicates rapid increase in price, long position can be taken keeping the upper limit as stop loss.](https://preview.redd.it/spqgzevpi1y41.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe0edf3d65d2f1872fc3b9b5408a6eb70f4e9bba)

**Moving Average** 

[Taking 9 period moving \(blue\) averages with 21 period moving averages \(red\). Bullish crossover is seen with price trading above the 9 period moving average so a long position can be taken as long as price trades above the moving average with 9 period moving average acting as a support.](https://preview.redd.it/9vohpsrxi1y41.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d04b14bcbb36bb1e8945a63cfec5524fd0aa4a0)

**Conclusion**

The price is trading at $0.454. The support is at $0.370 and the resistance is at $0.651. The price is expected to enter the public participation phase as indicated by the bollinger bands and the moving averages. Also the formation of the morning star pattern at support confirms the upward price movement. So long positions be taken Keeping stop loss around support. Using Fibonnaci and pivot point the price is expected to reach $0.834. It is suggested to be careful when the price reaches the resistance of $0.651 and look for false breakout.

Been slightly busy but I did not forget to review overnight activity (normally I do every midnight or every other midnight). As usual, let's get down to business. I've noticed some overnight activity forming a cup &amp; or a breakout both ARC &amp; SINO something must be cooking up something. Both charts are attractive indeed but one stood out most than the other and you know me by now, I love curve-like charts or even outside charts; SINO ended the day after hours with a big candle on the intraday chart while on the daily seems to be more or less forming a cup aka moon shot pattern.

ARC is a commercial &amp; or printing services, SINO is a global shipping logistics part of air freight &amp; courier services.

SINO strategy:

**Must maintain above support 0.39, HODL position 0.41, breakout point of 0.44, potential price target of 0.60 average to 0.70 max.**

ARC strategy:

**Must maintain above support 0.82, HODL position 0.89, breakout point (no resistance notice), potential price target average of 0.99 to 1.32 max.**

&amp;#x200B;

**SINO Pros &amp; CONS:**

[SINO Ascending triangle Bullish formation, by FINIV](https://ibb.co/k5GLXnQ)

[Supply/Demand on the rise](https://ibb.co/bsmM6Xy)

Good EPS since Q4 2019 - Q2 2020

No major institution bailouts

**Questions below I will be answering**:

Are you buying these Monday or anytime soon? I would but I am taking a risk/reward chance holding NAKD at this time,

Are they short or short term? Short term.

When will this spike? Often times I get this question, again I can't stress this enough but things I call out or tickers I notice can happen today, tomorrow, next week, or even weeks. Take prime examples of BIOC, TNPX, TRPX, RTTR. No one in any shape or form can predict ""when"". The only thing you have control in a chaotic probability butterfly effect is your reliable charts/Resistance/Support.

What's the best entry/exit? All listed above making easy friendly and trader ""dummy"" ease.

Should I go long? Like the moderators have penny stocks, not all stocks are meant for long investing, they are meant to be short/short term.

If you had to choose both stocks, which one would you choose? Possibly SINO considering delivery/orders/courier is on the demand and up by +2.62% vs commercial printing services about roughly 0.90%.

I‚Äôm trying to understand a trailing stop limit order. 
I‚Äôm holding a stock and hoping it will rise on the recent news from yesterday and I want to follow the rise but be able to sell if it heads back down 

My understanding Is I set a dollar amount or percentage that follows the current price and changes as the price rises.
I trade with TD and it asks for a trigger delta and limit delta. 
Can someone help me understand the difference

Namtsok9	1589119003	"Howdy,

Lexagene ($LXXGF) is a small Canadian company that I was alerted to by several veterinarians. Lexagene is making an on-site CoVid-19 test than can do multiple tests in an hour, instead of the 24-36 hr off site testing. I think this is a damn good company and I'm hoping this medium term play profits before Q4, and shows that there are more to penny stocks than pump and dumps.

Today I'm going to try to rationalize my heavy investment on a friggin penny stock. 

**TLDR:** [**EZ PowerPoint**](https://lexagene.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LexaGene-INVESTOR-Presentation_April23web.pdf)

**Company:**

LexaGene is a biotechnology company developing a fully automated pathogen detection platform for use at the site of sample collection, which offers unprecedented ease-of-use, sensitivity, and breadth of pathogen detection. LexaGene‚Äôs technology aims to transform the way organizations prevent and diagnose disease in multi-billion dollar markets such as human clinical diagnostics, food safety, veterinary diagnostics, water quality monitoring, aquaculture pathogen surveillance, and more.

LexaGene‚Äôs patented microfluidic system was invented by company founder and CEO, Dr. Jack Regan, who was a lead scientist in developing a predecessor instrument designed for bio-warfare surveillance that was adopted by the Department of Homeland Security for the BioWatch Program and a second R&amp;D instrument that was designed for detecting respiratory pathogens from nasal swab samples. The development of these instruments was supported by $20M in government funding.

**Product:**

LexaGene is developing a genetic analyzer for automated pathogen detection that is designed to be placed at the site of sample collection ‚Äì to quickly detect multiple pathogens at once with sensitivity and specificity ‚Äì and return results in about 1 hour.

The LX Genetic Analyzer is being designed for syndromic testing in veterinary diagnostics and human clinical diagnostics, as well as food safety testing, water quality monitoring, and other markets that need critical answers in less time.

The technology‚Äôs open-access feature allows researchers in biotech, pharma, and academic laboratories to customize their testing, whether it is to detect rare infectious diseases, screen for cancer, or perform mRNA expression profiling.

The open-access feature also makes the system uniquely poised to become a critical part of preventing the spread of emerging strains of new infectious diseases to help avert a pandemic.

**Financials:**

[Recent Financial Reports](https://lexagene.com/financial-information/)

Lexagene has a small market cap of around \~50M. In April, warrants were exercised producing more cash flow. This company is cashflow negative without a product which is common in biotechs.

**Timeline Highlights:      Q3**  

* FDA EUA Approval
* Manufacturing (announced partnership with [Ximedica](https://lexagene.com/release/2020/lexagene-provides-corporate-update-2/) 3/22/20)
* Sales (announced partnership with marketing firm [Native Ads NYC](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/23/2021353/0/en/LexaGene-Holdings-Proposes-to-Amend-Warrants-Terms-and-Announces-a-Strategic-Marketing-Promotional-Campaign.html) marketing firm)

**Board:** 

The most important decider of the future of a penny stock is the board. Judge for yourselves if this company has a legit website/director board and is not just another TTI/UAVS/ALPP pump and dump [HERE](https://lexagene.com/directors/).

**2nd Opinions:**

* [Yahoo board discussion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LXXGF/community?p=LXXGF)
* [Stockhouse board discussion](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard?symbol=lxxgf)

**Summary:** 

Whole lot of big moves coming up in Q3, and we're in a slight dip. I would not be surprised if this is the last buying opportunity before news comes out about sales hires and manufacturing, or FDA approval. I've read the research papers and had research doctors who specialize in PCR and pathology look it over and convinced them that its a company to be watching. I've never done a DD before and I know this is all from their website, but hey I'm a geologist so do what you want with it I'm just introducing this to share with folks that help me makes a few bucks here and there.

okboomer4206942069	1589052215	"$Hear beat earnings and and raised guidance yet went down on Friday, you are probably wondering why like I was.

The reason for the dip on Friday can be explained by 2 factors. The first is profit taking by some who got in at $4-6 in March that saw this as a peak, I do not blame them, but this stock is just getting started. The second factor is that a sell wall was set up at $10 by short sellers to keep the day under $10. There is a large short interest in this stock currently trying to manipulate the price. 

Now that I have explained the downtrend it‚Äôs time to tell you why the stock will crush on Monday and the next few months. The numbers for new guidance that were presented are modest at best. The company is factoring in sales being pulled forward from Christmas to now. This assumption is inaccurate due to two major factors. The first being that sales of consoles has been raised 155% since lockdown and the demand for headsets has followed that to an extent, however the demand for headsets will be more elongated as those who skipped out on a headset with their initial purchase realize the value of the product. This also plays heavily in turtle beach‚Äôs favor, because a consumer that elects not to buy a headset due to extra cost initially and then in the future purchases one will likely buy a product in the sub $50 market where turtle beach dominates the market. The second factor is the launch of new consoles. Older model headsets will be compatible with the next gen console, however when a consumer elects to spend $400-500 on a gaming system it is easier to justify a $50 purchase to enhance your new product. This will be similar to the Fortnight boom the company experienced only this time enhanced by the release of new consoles. 

Ok so the stock is up 58% in the last month are the insiders cashing out? No, insiders have been accumulating shares over the past months.

I forgot to mention they gained 500 points of market exposure in their main market, and gained exposure outside of the gaming market. Oh yeah and $0 debt!

Ok so I showed why this is a good longterm investment now why would Monday be a huge day? The factors above combined with a big dip on Friday will lead to high interest in this stock on Monday. When this interest depletes the short‚Äôs sell wall at $10  a break out will begin. This breakout will be amplified as the large short interests start to buy shares to close positions. ‚ÄúShort squeeze‚Äù 

To be transparent I do have calls on this stock.

loudog513	1589048754	So the stock is obviously way down based on everyone‚Äôs belief that bankruptcy is eminent.  Their debt is massive and apparently HTZ bonds are now trading at .20 on the dollar.  It seems to me there is good reason to believe they will not file for bankruptcy.  Those holding HTZ debt would take a substantial loss in bankruptcy given that used cars have substantially devalued recently.  Shareholders would be completely wiped out in bankruptcy.  It seems the only hope all stakeholders have is to hold on and hope the company comes back around.  Plus the largest shareholder- Carl Icahn- bought several million more shares back in March.  I can‚Äôt see him doing that and then just letting the company burn .  It seems worth the risk.

mtmtrader	1589044165	"Every morning that the market is open I share a morning watchlist on social media with info such as news headlines, support levels, resistance levels, and number of outstanding shares for stocks that are making big moves. I get asked pretty frequently why I include the number of outstanding shares and how it is relevant for day trading stocks. I wanted to make this post to explain the importance of it and share how I use it in my own trading. Hopefully after reading this you'll see why I share this data on my watchlists and you'll check for this number before each of your trades because it can be very beneficial and is a simple way to help manage your risk in the market.

*Let's start with the obvious question you may have... what are outstanding shares?*

The number of **outstanding shares** is simply the total number of shares a publicly traded company has. This includes the shares that you and I can trade as retail traders, the shares that are traded and held by institutions/hedge funds/banks, and even the shares that are owned by company insiders. Anyone can very easily look up the number of outstanding shares a company has. You can do this in your trading platform, on websites like [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or [finviz](https://finviz.com/), or you can look into the company's most recent earnings report and see the number directly from their [SEC filings](https://www.bamsec.com/). The screenshot below shows where the number of outstanding shares is located for $AAPL in the thinkorswim mobile platform on the right shows the same number located on the first page of $AAPL's most recent earnings report filing. You'll find this info in the same location for any spot, $AAPL was just use for this example.

[https://imgur.com/a/cTAkHue](https://imgur.com/a/cTAkHue) 

Outstanding shares differs slightly from a stock's float, but the way that they affect the stock can go hand in hand. A stock's **float** is the number of shares available to be traded by the public, like you and I. You can find a stock's float by subtracting the total number of closely held shares *(by company insiders, employees, etc.)* from the total number of outstanding shares. Although traders seem to talk more about a stock's float than the number of outstanding shares, I personally like to focus more on the outstanding shares because it can be difficult to find accurate float data in a limited amount of time.

The reason for that is because a company does not directly state their float data in their SEC filings like they do their outstanding shares. This means that in order to get accurate float data, you have to research and find the number of closely held shares by digging through filings and then subtract that number from the total number of outstanding shares. You can look for a stock's float on 3 different websites like [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [finviz](https://finviz.com/), and [marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/) and many times you'll end up with 3 completely different numbers.

The number of outstanding shares may be more commonly used for calculating a company's market capitalization, but it's definitely a valuable number for short-term trading as well. This number can be thought of as the **supply**, and the volume for the stock can be thought of as the **demand**. When there is a low supply *(in this case meaning a low float or low amount of shares outstanding)* and high demand, generally there will be a larger amount of volatility in that stock compared to one with a larger supply.

For example, you can look at the number of shares outstanding for stocks with the largest % gain on any given day, and you will find that a large majority of them have less than 100 million shares outstanding. Now, 100 million isn't a magical number for picking big runners, but stock's with many more shares outstanding than that tend to have less volatility and less potential for huge runs in my experience. In fact, if you look back on the biggest supernovas from the past few years, you'll notice that they all had under 100 million shares outstanding, and many of them even having less than 10 million shares. In the screenshot below you can see the huge spike in the stock **$DRYS** from 2017 when it went from under $5 to over $100 in just a few days. Since then $DRYS has done many reverse splits and offerings, but at the time it had a very low float of only around 1 million shares.

[https://imgur.com/a/H3gEdyq](https://imgur.com/a/H3gEdyq) 

As you can see, volatility doesn't just work on the upside though. $DRYS, like many big runners, came down just as quickly as it went up. That's why trading low floats with higher volatility can create a higher risk, higher reward situation. With that being said, one of the ways I use the number of outstanding shares is to give myself an idea of the stock's expected volatility. If it has a low supply, I most likely will trade a smaller-than-usual position size to **reduce my risk** in the trade that is expected to be highly volatile.

In my opinion, this is especially important with longer-term trades and investments. Generally the goal of an investment is to profit from a slow and steady rise over a long period of time. If you're investing in stocks with a low number of outstanding shares, you'll most likely have to deal with much more volatility and larger drawdowns in your positions. Aside from the dilution, poor financials, and frequent pump and dumps, this is one of the reasons that penny stocks do **not** make good investments, even though they can be great for short-term trading and scalping.

MantonX2	1589467552	"Wanted to get your takes on this.  Researching some unrelated stocks, I came across a couple of pieces on this company (Sun Kissed Industries Inc).  From what I can see, they've been around since 1981 in one form or another.  Strange mixed bag of sectors.  Game development involving cryptocurrency, CBD marketplace and now they seem to be acquiring and trying to acquire other technology but not sure why.  


Two days ago, they acquired PushNote, a social media/marketing app that looks as if it's about to release an Android app (to go along with its iOS app - [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-note/id962393538](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-note/id962393538) \- this fits the description of what the app does, but I'm not 100% sure).  Press release(not an AP story) from them on the acquisition:  [https://apnews.com/PR%20Newswire/90d4b3a91ea6bfbd56868a6c17c32b43](https://apnews.com/PR%20Newswire/90d4b3a91ea6bfbd56868a6c17c32b43)   

&amp;#x200B;

Stock history is pretty much them bobbing near $0.01 a share for half a year.  Normally, I wouldn't even give something so low a second look but the acquisition and seemingly disconnected techs piqued my curiosity.  The upside of the stock price is any catalyst could cause an appreciable movement up from where it has been sitting for the last 6 months is a big % jump.  Downside, well .. it's a penny to sub-penny stock.  lol  


Any thoughts from any one?  That curious cat inside of me keeps wondering why they fully acquired PushNote."	SKDI - Looking for thoughts	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjnpex/skdi_looking_for_thoughts/

Ticker: BCRX
Ticker's Most Recent Price: $6.10
Comment: Galidesivir - it is made by the publicly traded company BioCryst (BCRX) - there are other adenosine analogues but they didn't have anything noteworthy going on. It looks like BCRX is currently conducting and winding down a clinical study in Brazil, so results should be posted soon in the coming days/weeks (estimated study completion date is 5/31/21, and they started in April). 

This is just pure speculation and hypothesis, but looking at the molecular data for both drugs, I would think that Galidesivir is the more stable of the two since it can be stored at a higher temperature in powder form without denaturing. Also, it being easier to store would potentially make it the more popular of the two, especially in clinics where getting a medical grade freezer (that reaches -20 to -80C) may be hard. For reference, Galidesivir can be stored at +4C in powder form unlike Remdesivir which must be stored in the aforementioned range. Furthermore, if we look at the molecular weights of the two drugs, we see that Galidesivir is much lighter, and lower molecular weights are generally correlated with an increase in biological activity of the drug (better uptake). In layman's terms, I would think that the results from Galidesivir's study will be good, if not better than GILD's Remdesivir study. 

Financially, I think the company is doing very well, all things considered. While their most recent quarterly report did show a loss of $0.24/share they seem to have a good outlook. They do not expect COVID-19 to cause any delays with their drug development or commercial launch preparations, which is definitely reassuring. Currently, institutional ownership is very high at 89.65%, but I think this is good for those of us that get calls as this could drive the price of the stock up provided none of these institutions liquidate their positions. 

The Play: I'm thinking calls in the $7-10 range for 6/19 or 7/17. If you are a shares kinda person then I think that this company will be a great longterm hold (at least 6-12+ months) as they have other drugs in their pipeline that seem promising (one is being reviewed by the FDA and a decision should be made in Dec 2020/early 2021).

Of course, this could be the nature of some of the stocks I'm holding. I just wanted to discuss trading after a the market goes red. I theorize that there's a low volume due to fear of losses. The Wallstreet Journal published, ""U.S Stock Futures Wobble Ahead of Jobless Claims Data"". 

I read somewhere Warren Buffet said he would be bold and buy during these times of fear. Is there merit to this kind of thinking? It seems to me that if individuals invested in, let's say, the dips in petrol and airlines that they would make a killing when the virus either tapers off or there's a viable vaccine for it.

I'm just trying to learn a little more regarding the full gestalt of how the market leviathan operates and reacts to happenings. Some sectors are doing alright, however. I think biotech has been doing well as far as I can tell. Seems like everyone is banking on them finding a solid treatment for the virus.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FqgPz5_0jgD9NIAWCILv9hhsUAbLB59D7BajyTSbFZ0/edit?usp=sharing

But a bit has changed. Since then they had an offering (hence the dramatic from from 1.80s to 1.10s a few weeks back), to raise funds for FDA approval for their Hep B vaccine, which is more effective than any current alternative. They now have the $50m in cash they need for stuff like that, and the buyout was bought out by a number of big players like Perceptive.

They're waiting on approval for Government funding IIRC too, so news of that should help it further up soon.

BedfastDuck	1589452817	"People rallying troops because the guy was a pumper is not cool. We collectively as a sub are pumpers, with some of us successfully being dumpers and some being bag holders (see TRNX back in July of last year, IBIO in Feb/March of this year, UAVS, MVIS, the list goes on). Some people sought out salm10 specifically to expose him as a pumper and to harass him on his stocktwits profile, which is considered a witch-hunt. This sub does not have antiwitch-hunting rules and in the interest of some people getting upset because they hopped on the wrong hype train, this absolutely needs to change. Moderators need to consider a couple new rules, including antiwitch-hunt as well as removal of posts that are not discussing stocks specifically. I know it would be rather difficult to moderate, especially with the large influx of new investors, however it is to both help protect people as well as help people learn DD.

Example: ""Salm11 said on stocktwits that TOPS is going to hit $500 by the end of the month.üöÄ"" with the post being tagged as DD. This post would be removed, as it is more of a promotion of Salm11 and has little to add to the conversation of the stock itself. If the user posted ""TOPS is going to hit $500"" this changes the subject to be more about TOPS and saves Salm11 from being burnt at the stake when this doesn't happen. Comments underneath may discuss Salm11 and his thoughts on the stock, but should be considered civil.

In the end, people are here to make money, not to bash one another's methods of doing so. Please treat each other, as well as people who are not members of this sub who are voicing their opinion on stocktwits, with respect."	What occured with Salm10 would be classified as a witch-hunt and should be taken seriously in forging new rules for this sub.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjjx6n/what_occured_with_salm10_would_be_classified_as_a/

yrall	1589424210	"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ageagle-receives-purchase-orders-manufacture-123010268.html

I bought in after news broke that they were expanding into eCommerce drone making and had received purchase orders from a major eCommerce company. Some people are guessing that Amazon is that eCommerce company. Makes sense that Amazon is currently investing in delivery drones bc Amazon announced that they were spending all of their profits from 1Q to make their employees safer from COVID. Utilizing drones to deliver packages will help reduce COVID risk for Amazon employees. 

This week, UAVS sold $6M in shares in a direct offering to some German investment firm called Alpha Capital Anstalt (who was already a major shareholder) to raise capital to fund their expansion into delivery drones. When the news broke that they were selling $6M in shares at $1.06 the stock dropped from over $2 to around $1. I bought in more heavily once it dropped following stock offering. It‚Äôs been slowly climbing since then, but I believe it‚Äôs about to skyrocket leading up to their 1Q earnings date. Once they announce their earnings date, it‚Äôll end up on people‚Äôs radars who do earnings plays and volume will increase as earnings date approaches and drive up the price of the stock. Once they announce who the eCommerce company is, I think it will go up again.

Anyone have any theories as to who the eCommerce company ordering drones from UAVS is?

Clickstream Corporation is an upcoming app that offers a live gameshow that allows people to win money. The app is free but of course there's in-app purchases which will most likely be their primary source of income. From looking at their website the app kind of looks like HQ Trivia, a popular gameshow app that gives free money. HQ was successful so maybe Clickstream will be too. Their website is at the bottom if you wanna visit it (link 1)

On March 30 Clickstream filed a 1-A form. According to Investopedia this form is made by ""entities seeking exemption for registration requirements for certain public offerings."" I don't really understand this because the words are too big but from what I can figure they want to make a public offering without needing to follow a bunch of rules, I assume this is either because they are an OTC stock and it's hard for them to make an offering, or they're gonna file an offering to take your money and run. If you wanna read more about what a 1-A form is then go to link 2. The stocks average volume is 21,597 and today it was 8 million. The market cap of this stock is 1.24 million dollars.

Sorry if this post is short as I said before it's an OTC company and there isn't really much information on it as it was basically dead until now. I think it blew up because Brian Baldinger is going on their show/app (check link 3). I thought Clickstream was lying about Baldinger being signed but he posted the news himself on his Twitter so I guess not.

**General Biotech Reverse Merger Play**  


Generally,  reverse mergers show up in biotech because companies fail often, IPO's  are expensive and their IPO politics are dicey. So they can be hit or  miss. Basically, the public company that becomes the shell is usually  just a placeholder and I think that's Ritter Pharms' role here. However,  the Ritters management seems to have held on to a low stock price for  about a year, while waiting for further progress in clinical trials.  
About  6-9 months ago, their investment/admin advisors were pressing them to  find a compatible rev. merger partner or some other exit. I'm not sure  if Ritter found Qualigen bc Qualigen was already looking or whether it  was just VC/investor/industry networking to find matching needs.  Probably the latter, as there's not really a strategic match in Ritter's  IP/products ... but there could be.

This article has a good overview on the subject: [""Are reverse mergers a good way for biotechs to go public?""](https://gilmartinir.com/are-reverse-mergers-a-good-way-for-biotechs-to-go-public/)  


**$RTTR: Ritter Pharmaceuticals**  


Ritter's  market cap is 22M, but has no revenue (all their eggs in one basket)  but I reviewed their combined SEC S-4 filings and both companies will  have \~ $11M in assets + cash, with Qualigen reporting $500,000k in  revenue from a ""FastTrak"" VitaminD panel and Testosterone panel, where  they own patents related to the FastTrak tech. So they'll at least have  some cash (about $4M - $6M, enough to finance another year of  operations? just my gut there, i don't remember their operations  specifically)

**Qualigen (private)**  


[Qualigen Therapeutics Pipeline](https://www.qualigeninc.com/therapeutics-pipeline/)  


Qualigen  has been filing patents and been in business for at least a decade.  Neither company has done this reverse merger before. Qualigen licenses  some tech related to their nano AuNP therapies, but I'm not sure of the  structure there. Qualigen's two closest products to market are from  their AS1411 line, which is based on binding to nucleolins on cell  membranes. These have been in phase II since at least 2013 (i'm just now  finding that out, so i'm not sure of the details there). the AuNP  product's are dependent on that AS1411 line and are still in pre-IND, so  not even Phase I.   


Here's the complete [reverse merger SEC S-4 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1460702/000149315220005858/forms-4a.htm#z_005)  


**My overall take on it:**  


I  donno, it seems like a good short-to-medium position, maybe? i put $55  into it. I might lose it and I'm alright with that. there is a reverse  stock split of RTTR shares that will be 25:1 or 35:1 (so my 100 should  turn into 3 or 4 and some change). This class of former RTTR stock will  become \~7.5% of the total shares after the deal, where Qualigen controls  the remaining 92.5% of shares (of common stock, i think?). The details  aren't quite fresh in my head right now.

Anyway...  it looks like they will titrate new shares to the market as they plan  to use promising milestones in Qualigen treatment/diagnostic development  to drive speculation. In terms of going short/medium on the stock, it  seems like it's an alright deal, since there's only a few bottlenecks  for Qualigen that can sink the deal ... but they should be able to  compensate by developing new diagnostics.   


Both companies need  cash though and so that's a complementary benefit they're both getting.  They're both pooling their resources and probably liquidating some  assets."

boccherini-trader	1589408711	"Two days ago we posted a write-up on the good likelihood that Allogene (ALLO) would demonstrate positive safety and efficacy data from their P1 trial in their ASCO abstract. **Today, positive results led to a &gt;40% return after-hours. We made adjustments to our position on this news.** Here's a quick download of what was found in the paper:

**TL;DR:** The relatively clean safety sheet overall coupled with our expectation that the higher dose groups will be enriched for the complete responders once we get a deeper look on 5/29 has us confident that Allogene is triangulating on a relatively safe, highly efficacious dose to take forward into further development.

\---

The ASCO abstracts including  Allogene's ALPHA trial abstract have been released. All in all the abstract supports our thesis for Allogene that we walked through in our recent write up, though we will need to wait for the 5/29 presentation for a more detailed look at the data. Key takeaways from the abstract include: 

1) No dose-limiting toxicities or GvHD observed: this is great news 

2) Only 2 (22.2%) of patients developed Grade 1 - 2 CRS, which resolved within 72 hours 

3) 78% ORR, including 3 complete responses. Given this was a dose-ranging study, what we will be looking for in the 5/29 readout is how the higher dose groups in particular responded, since these will likely be the doses taken into the pivotal trial."

TigBurdus	1589407167	"I have been following this subreddit for quite some time, and I have decided it is time for me to start getting involved and making some moves.I have a lot of faith in this community and I think with some time and research I could really benefit by starting to trade, especially because I have nothing to do right now due to quarantine.

Webull and Robinhood are two sites/apps that I have heard a good deal about, I'm just curious what the majority would recommend and what the possible pros and cons are with each one. I would say the most important feature for me would be to see and trade the numbers in real time and its not going to screw me over by updating or processing in 5-10 minutes. Other than that, any user friendly features are a plus. I'm open to other recommendations as well.

One last slightly unrelated question I have is regarding taxes. How do you guys handle this? I understand I need to know what I paid originally and what I sold for. But considering this is ""tax free"" profit it would be necessary to hold on to it until tax season right? Anyone end up owing a bunch of money because of their stock trades?

Cameron_Nick	1589407071	"I get he never provided anything with the reason he thinks it‚Äôll go how high he says but that‚Äôs your job as your own investor. He was giving you companies and you could do your own DD.

Some people say he never responded and was most likely a bit, these people came from this subreddit and only seen the last week of his posts. Scroll down a ways you‚Äôll see he use to be extremely active with responding to people but when you gain 6k followers in 7 days obviously you can‚Äôt respond to everyone.

And for the people saying he used his following for his own pump and dumps, I don‚Äôt believe that is true. Sure if all 7k people bought in on what he said just because he said it I‚Äôm sure it would change the market, even half that could. But when he was still making all these predictions months ago with only a few hundred followers, how do you think he even would do that with that little of a following? Even if everybody that followed him bought in which I doubt they did when he had a few hundred it wouldn‚Äôt change the market short term by 50-150% like a lot of his posts say. He was more or less a short term. 2+ weeks and you could have seen that if you even scrolled down 2 weeks. His calls don‚Äôt hit his goal until weeks after. 

Too many people high strung on emotions followed him and when they bought in and the market rose a little and then dropped from people selling (most likely people who also follow him from this subreddit who are just pumping and dumping right away and taking small profits)

IMO if you go into a stock just because some dude was right a few times and get emotional when it drops right after you buy, you shouldn‚Äôt be trading."	Why‚Äôs everyone so butthurt about Salm10?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gj8sdw/whys_everyone_so_butthurt_about_salm10/

Im pleasantly surprised sometimes on reddit whenever i see a post thats truly accurate. Most of the spam on here lately has been just terrible to read with shills everywhere. It only took 2 days for chas to be proven right. Actually reading the comments on his post were hilarious now because he warned of exactly what happened. He actually was scammy salm lol. Im happy to see that proper DD sometimes can pay big rewards like even avoiding losing bigtime on some dump pumper. Thank you guys for your help! I think im just gonna figure out my own path to trading well without bothering with these stupid pumpers anymore tbh.

I wanted to do a 'green investment'. Landed on AVANTIUM. With:

\- the ESG rules coming in hot in Europe at the end of this year; 

\- Coca Cola + Carlsberg backing them up; 

\- their factory most likely being completed around the end of this year;

\- and the bottles hitting the shelves around 2023;

this company seems to have a very, very bright future. Cashposition seems pretty bad, but they're already cutting losses, with big investors and upcoming law behind them.

Will musicians just rely on composing sound tracks for netflix and video games and find haven with companies like Patreon?

&amp;#x200B;

Partial Script:

JCP is a department store that primarily sells family apparel, footwear, accessories, fine fashion, jewelry and beauty products to name a few. As of November 2019 it operated approximately 850 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. JCP was founded in 1902 and is based in Plano, Texas. The financials for the last 4 years are like this: In 2017 JCP reported a revenue of 12.92 Billion and a loss of -17 million. In 2018 the company reported revenue of 12.87 billion and a loss of -118.00 million. In 2019 the company reported revenue of 12.02 billion and an earnings loss of 225 million. In 2020 the company reported revenue of 11.1 7 billion and a loss of 268 million. JCP has a current market cap of 74.532 million and is currently trading for .23 cents per share. The company's 52 week range is 0.15-1.26. The company has an EPS of -0.84 and its next earnings date report is May 19, 2020 to May 25, 2020. JCP has also reportedly filed for bankruptcy and is rumored to almost lose up to 700 stores. In court documents, the retailer said it plans to  focus on customer service, apparel and low prices."

From here you can see Co-Diagnostics (CODX)'s Testing Kit: Logix Smart‚Ñ¢ Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Kit is at a very high LOD:

[https://asm.org/Articles/2020/April/False-Negatives-and-Reinfections-the-Challenges-of](https://asm.org/Articles/2020/April/False-Negatives-and-Reinfections-the-Challenges-of)

**Limit of Detection of COVID-19 Tests**¬†

In practical terms, the limit of detection (LOD) for an RT-PCR test tells you the minimum amount of RNA that the test will detect 95 out of 100 times. If the limit of detection (LOD) for a test is¬† too high, patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 may not test positive, leading to a high rate of false-negative results. If the LOD for a test is too low, then contamination can become a major problem, as the test will detect the tiniest amounts of viral RNA, leading to false-positive test results (i.e., people who are not infected with SARS-CoV-2 will test positive instead of negative). The art of determining how much viral RNA detected in a person is clinically significant, and therefore the target LOD for an accurate test, is just that...an art.

Would like to hear thoughts of a medical professional if you are in this sub thanks!

Meanwhile, some experts have raised questions as to the accuracy of the Co-Diagnostics test used at the TestUtah sites.

Shares in Co-Diagnostics tripled in late February, when it received certification to sell its coronavirus test in Europe. On April 3, the day the state signed its contract with Nomi, Co-Diagnostics received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell its test in the United States.

Now the company is supplying thousands of tests in Iowa and Nebraska, where state officials last week issued no-bid contracts worth more than $50 million to Nomi and the TestUtah team.

But the Co-Diagnostics test has a ‚Äúhigher limit of detection compared to tests offered by more established vendors,‚Äù Lopansri wrote, referring to the test‚Äôs sensitivity. A higher limit of detection means more virus is required in a sample to trigger a positive result."

Basically, this a merger company that is basically a tool that a company will use to do an IPO. Once the ipo happens, the shares from this company are transferred 1:1. 

What makes this so interesting is their target company is a plant based foods company, one that is already in all the big stores.

We saw with beyond burger that they exploded after their IPO and have seen huge gains. In a couple weeks beyond meats stock more than doubled.

Once news of this merger reaches the mainstream, expect a lot of hype from the media and thus this stock will be pumped hard. 

It‚Äôs never pumped yet because this deal is relatively lowkey and in somewhat early stages.

They have a stock holders meeting in June 8th to discuss the plan for the merger and possibly announce the target company.

And then last night Powell went back to his hawkish tone on 60 minutes. The SPY is approaching 300, also looking good. I have two friends who work as nurses in hospitals and they said people my age have nothing to worry about with beer virus anymore in our area  (unless you have medical conditions) which is also good.

The stock is intended to raise money by garnering investors, and use that money to build the company and make those investors more money. But with pennies, we typically pump and dump. Sure there‚Äôs the occasional one that the rocket never comes back from. Usually it‚Äôs make the quick buck while everyone pumps into the same penny as us, then drop it. The company gets nothing out of that because the money just disappears. So what are your thoughts on how that can play out in the long term livelihood of the company? 

I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs anything wrong with making the quick buck, even at the expense of the companies‚Äô existence. It is definitely a dog eat mouse world.

Vivid_Mood	1590114395	"Well I have a pretty bad headache. What a tragic day it's been, after only trading for a few months. Let me start this by saying my emotions got the best of me, and it really hurt. I wasn't ready or expecting to take the loss I did, but I did learn a lot about myself in such a short period of time. Let's go over the trade today:

I am subscribed to warrior tradings chatroom. He's been amazing at giving his mindset, and helping people like me emulate a winning mindset. So today he was watching XTNT, a running stock. In case you don't know, he calls everything out live in his room. I put typed in XTNT and saw it at 2.80. Then I hear him call out that he's gotten long in a position. Seeing how there were many stocks that ran in the past week, this seemed like another. So I didn't want to miss the next big runner. As usual, I was slow to place my orders in. I ended up getting filled at 2.93, and added again at 3. Then a nightmare happened, went into a bad halt. Now at this point, warrior said he was ready to bail. I was in my position full size, and stuck down 80 cents with a 3.10 average long. Then, next thing I know the stock doesn't bounce and warriors out of his position. Unfortunately, my emotions got the best of me, and I held on. It held 2.40 well, and I was thinking it was going to squeeze all the way to about 3 for a nice gain, but it didn't. It broke 2.40, and snapped all the way to 2.00, where I covered at 2.01 for a blow up loss. My emotions got the best of me and I was greedy when I should've taken it off at $3 when warrior said it was holding. Instead, I held and held, until it was over.

This experience has been extremely important as a learning and educational experience. I'm going to come back stronger, and not let my emotions get the best of me. Next month I'll be coming back in pursuit of becoming a top 5% trader, funding my account, and re-subscribe to get a better education.

Our B2B brick and mortar sales were $5.9 million or 30% of total net sales, an increase of $4.5 million or 321% from the prior year period. Our operating expenses for the March quarter were $12.2 million, of which approximately $665,000 was non-cash expenses, resulting in a cash use of $4.2 million for the quarter. Year to date our operating expenses were $24.8 million, of which approximately $1.5 million was non-cash expenses, resulting in a cash use of approximately $9.1 million for the six months ending March 31, 2020,"" said Martin Sumichrast, Chairman and co-CEO of the Company.

""In addition, in early March we started to take measures at our Company to help secure the health of our employees and vendors. When the stay at home order in North Carolina was implemented, we temporarily closed our corporate office, instituted a remote work structure and altered work schedules at our manufacturing and warehouse facilities. We also took steps to increase production to build up our finished goods inventory as well as purchased additional raw material inventory items thereby allowing us to maintain production if supply chain interruptions were to happen, which at this point I am happy to say has not happened. In short, while we have had to make significant logistical changes during the past 60 days, our team has risen to the challenge and our business has remained fully open and operational. We are also happy to report that as of today, we are not aware of any of our employees who have tested positive for COVID-19,"" said Sumichrast.

""Along with taking the necessary safety measures, we also immediately instituted a rigorous cost containment plan across all departments and shifted our resources from our B2B retail brick and mortar sales to our direct to consumer online sales. The result has been quite remarkable. While we normally don‚Äôt discuss mid quarter results, we are in an unprecedented time, and therefore we have decided to discuss our company‚Äôs operations for April, our first full post COVID-19 impacted month.""

""First of all, our overall sales in April were in line with sales in March. Second, we are seeing a significant shift in our overall sales blend, where now our direct to consumer online sales are tracking at 80%, up from 62% of overall sales in fiscal 2019. This of course has helped us maintain a very healthy overall gross profit margin, which we believe we can maintain at 65% or higher. Third, and most dramatic, our overall operating expenses have been reduced by approximately 40% in April from our monthly average in the prior quarter. Some of this operational cost reduction is the direct result of cancellations of certain marketing spends, but others, such as travel and trade shows, are a direct effect from the changing environment brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The net result of all of these changes is that in April we are showing an approximate 85% decrease in our loss from operations from just a few months prior, and we are seeing this carry through as we cross the mid-way point in May. While the uncertainty caused by the pandemic has required us to withdraw our fiscal 2020 financial revenue guidance, based on what we experiencing, we remain confident that we will achieve our target of positive cash flow by the end of calendar 2020, and perhaps sooner. In addition, with approximately $14.8 million in cash on hand at March 31, 2020, and the dramatic improvement in our operating results, we believe we have more than enough financial cushion to get us to profitability. Despite these truly unprecedented times, we are thankful that early this year we made bold strategic decisions, such as becoming fully capitalized in January of 2020, paying for our infrastructure so we have almost no debt, promoting our online direct to consumer business model which has allowed us to pivot when needed, and choosing to operate our business with a view towards variable cost initiatives,"" said Sumichrast.

""We are pleased to announce that our agreement with Life Time, Inc., where cbdMD is the Exclusive CBD Partner of Life Time, is expanding to include the sales of cbdMD products through both Life Time e-commerce and retail (in-club) channels. With approximately two million active members, Life Time provides an incredible opportunity to directly offer our robust line of THC-free CBD products to this targeted base of customers, who are laser focused on the importance of health and wellbeing each and every day. We feel confident that, as our products are introduced online through https://shop.lifetime.life/ and in their 145+ fitness facilities nationwide, sales will be significant. One indication of the potential demand among their membership is that research provided to us by Life Time indicated that ""cbdMD"" was the number one searched term on the Life Time e-commerce website since our partnership began in October 2019. We are excited to get our products in Life Time's Spas and Cafes as well as in the hands of all the nutritionists and fitness coaches serving their two million members. cbdMD, and our commitment to health and wellness, represents a perfect fit with Life Time since our roster of Team cbdMD athletes include some of the biggest and most notable individuals in their respective sports, our products are THC-Free and, like Life Time, cbdMD is a leading, trusted brand, which as consumer purchase data regarding CBD suggests, is a dominant factor in decision making,"" said Sumichrast."

Cicero1982	1590105303	"If there‚Äôs one thing I love about penny stocks in this market is they make sense and they are easy to predict. The same cannot be said about the underlying market. The NASDAQ continues to go up despite crazy unemployment, low oil prices, a stagnant economy, poor earnings, messed up supply chains, China troubles, and a probable second waive of COVID-19. This is how I approach this market. 

I find one or two solid plays. Could be penny‚Äôs, could not. Buy in slowly and average down as necessary. Sell the pops for anything above $100 profit. Rinse and repeat.   

I don‚Äôt chase stocks, I don‚Äôt fall into the hype, I don‚Äôt follow trends, I don‚Äôt average up, I don‚Äôt day trade (though I can), and I certainly don‚Äôt listen to anyone here. I aim to make on average $100-$300 in profit each day. It‚Äôs been working well for me. I‚Äôm up 47% for the year. 

For whatever my bullshit recommendation is worth I see more pain ahead and you will not be able to cope with it unless you are either smartly playing the pennies (which don‚Äôt follow market trends), or picking one or two solid and reliable plays. I have been 3/4ths liquidated since the beginning of the corona virus and if trading were my only source of income I could still make ends meet. 

I recommend you maintain a large cash position for future turmoil and trade safely. Accept smaller profits and be happy with the profit you‚Äôve got. Believe it or not your account will grow faster than you think. 

Warren Buffett is right to have a large cash position. This pump is a fools rally."	Warren Buffet is Right. Everyone for the Most Part Should be Largely Liquidated Right Now.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/go8by1/warren_buffet_is_right_everyone_for_the_most_part/

SEEL - Seelos Therapeutics 
‚ÄîI know this stock already had a run today up to 1.15, but settled down to right now 1.07 AH (today was about %10, but I think there‚Äôs more you can get out of this leading up to next week and further)

‚Äîtoday‚Äôs volume was 3.72 compared to its avg 2.25

‚Äîbecause of this weekend, tomorrow might be - great day to grab this as a play for Tuesday

‚ÄîThis Tuesday, SEEL‚Äôs CEO/Chairman is hosting a call with a key opinion leader to discuss the unmet medical needs in suicide and depression. SEEL‚Äôs lead candidate is Intranasal Racemic Ketamine (SLS-002) for Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior in patients with Major Depressive Disorder.

‚Äîalso, in mid-June they will participate in the Benchmark Company Healthcare House Call Virtual Video 1√ó1 Investor Conference

‚ÄîSome analysts project this stock to rise to $4 (maybe not a realistic projection for the time you‚Äôd want to hold it anyway) but a more realistic projection for next week is around $1.75

Personally, I don‚Äôt see this as a long term play. My goal is to grab some tomorrow (possibly premarket or after the dips in premarket/afternoon) then sell it Tuesday morning.

Reading about the offering NNDM decided to release the break through news before ANN the $2 offering, which at the time was at $0.77 give or take, so they overvauled their stock.

I do see a long term growth in this stock and makes that one annaylist $18 target look like a genius. I personally rebought at 2.50 and 2.70. From a 70% drop from its high puts NNDM at 1.50.

Inmate_Baba	1590094971	"So I keep a bunch of charts up and I am always on the lookout for a stock that drops immediately when the bell rings, just like $TLSS did tis morning.

Watch it run but be aware of where your support levels are. You can see I got in at .0573 right after that long green candlestick. Another thing I do as I am watching it is go ahead and put the buy order in but I move it real low, so when I feel good about making the buy I just drag the order into range and it executes the trade, no fumbling around typing stock amounts in and when I should be executing the trade. Set a stop loss and go ahead and place a sell order up above so you can move it into selling range when your ready to execute the trade, you can see I have already bought the stock and there is a sell order at -10,000 waiting at .075. I am not hoping it gets to that amount, I just wait for upward momentum to start to slow down, don't be greedy, like I said this is scalp play, get your money and get out!

COVID-19Enthusiast	1590085338	"I accidentally sold some stock that hadn't cleared and now I'm flagged as a PTD so I need to find a new broker until my suspension period has passed. 

I've heard TD Ameritrade and ETrade are recommended most on here, but I looked into them and both charge a $6.95 commission fee for OTC stocks. I typically buy $100-200 worth of any one stock and flip it for a 5-20% gain, if I have to pay $13 everytime I do that I'm going to be losing money, that's not feasible. 

Keep in mind I'm talking about **OTC Stocks** here. I can see some people not realizing that and saying these brokers do not have fees so I want to emphasize that to avoid any confusion.

ExpertPerformer	1590083207	"So yesterday I started playing around with penny stocks and had some questions.

1) What stock screener website are you guys using to see the pre-market movement? finviz has a 15 minute delay before it starts updating at market open and yahoo finance doesn't show the stocks being pumped.

2) Are these pump-and-dump stocks that common? Since I started looking: yesterday and today there were at last 3 stocks that blew past 200% gains.

3) When do you jump in and bail out?

The biggest problem I've been having with jumping in on these is the trade halt orders. I tried getting it on XTNT and it was hit with back-to-back halt orders until it got dumped immediately after which helped me dodge a bullet. Then I jumped on SURF @ 6.35 and dumped it at 6.50 because it took about a half hour just to get there."

This data proved to be very popular and informative for shareholders and interested parties. We plan to post similar testing data for our GenViro!

Physicians performing atherectomy or crossing CTOs with other devices must rely solely on X-ray as well as tactile feedback to guide their interventions while treating complicated arterial disease. With the Lumivascular approach, physicians can more accurately navigate their devices and treat PAD lesions, thanks to the real-time OCT images generated from inside the artery, without exposing healthcare workers and patients to the negative effects of ionizing radiation.	$AVGR	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gnwcqf/avgr/

According to one analyst:

""Wall Street analysts have a consensus price target for the stock at $9.07, which means that the shares‚Äô value could jump 398.35% from current levels. The projected low price target is $2.5 while the price target rests at a high of $24.""

Robinhood says 7 reputable analysts say this is a must buy for the coming days. With a projected price point so high I would be happy with half that price point.

The recent resurgence of the cannabis stock space has been a surprising development to many market participants. Sentiment on this group was already in the basement before the pandemic panic took hold of the markets and crashed the whole game. But pot stocks found support in mid-March as a group.

Since then, the MJ ETF is up nearly 50%, and a quick survey of leading names will show a series of aggressive bounces and a few breakouts of significant size and force.

We would cite several factors behind the move, including cyclical inflection, seasonal cannabis pricing effects, the pandemic lockdown cabin fever, and expanded market share for the survivors after many stocks in the space failed to survive the depths of the bear.

In short, these stocks were completely washed out after two years of bear market action, only to take another huge hit in March when the broad market was obliterated. But, just on the other side of that crash, they ran into an improving demand context, a shortage of supply, and reduced competition.

The result has been an impressive rebound that could well represent the dawning of a brand new cannabis bouncing baby bull market trend still in diapers and a bonnet. There‚Äôs so much to look forward to: skepticism and short interest, unexpected growth, surprise M&amp;A deals, new analyst attention, big IPO‚Äôs, and eventually a supernova of hype, scandal, and nose-bleed valuations that leave latecomers with a bag to hold.

But that‚Äôs all down the road. Now, traders and investors have a chance to go shopping when these stocks are still unloved but just getting traction to the upside.

With that in mind, we present here a brief look at some of the smaller-cap names in the space that are sparking the most interest among traders in recent days: GrowGeneration Corp (NASDAQ:GRWG), Cannabis Strategic Ventures (OTCMKTS:NUGS), Cresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF), and Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA).

**GrowGeneration Corp (NASDAQ:GRWG)** has been putting up strong numbers in recent updates from the company, and the stock has been reacting well, surging as much as 100% from its March lows in the past two months.

The company managed to rope in revenues totaling $33M in overall sales during the company‚Äôs most recently reported quarterly financial data ‚Äî a figure that represents a rate of top line growth of 152%, as compared to year-ago data in comparable terms. If there‚Äôs any concerns here from a fundamental metric perspective, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($11.4M against $17.3M, respectively).

GrowGeneration Corp (OTCMKTS:GRWG) trumpets itself as a company that, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates retail hydroponic and organic gardening stores in the United States.

Currently, GrowGen has 27 stores, and carries and sells thousands of products, including organic nutrients and soils, advanced lighting technology and state of the art hydroponic equipment to be used indoors and outdoors by commercial and home growers.

According to company materials, ‚ÄúOur mission is to own and operate GrowGeneration branded stores in all the major states in the US and Canada. Management estimates that roughly 1,000 hydroponic stores are in operation in the US. By 2025 the market is estimated to reach over $30 billion with a compound annual growth.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre long this stock, then you‚Äôre liking how it has responded in recent days as well. GRWG shares have pushed about 27% to the upside on above average trading volume in the past week since releasing Q1 financials.

**Cannabis Strategic Ventures (OTCMKTS:NUGS)** is one of the fastest growing producers in the California cannabis market, with a record performance in April, where it saw an 800% sequential gain over calendar Q1 numbers to sell out of its inventory in early May.

But the company had anticipated this risk based on a steady acceleration in its new distribution partner agreements, and had already taken steps to more than double its production capacity, with that leap in production now starting to produce fresh cannabis for sale. That suggests coming sales data will continue to show monster second derivative growth throughout Q2.

Cannabis Strategic Ventures (OTCMKTS:NUGS) also recently announced that it is about to launch a full line of branded products which are already lined up to be featured through a partnership with one of the fastest growing cannabis delivery services in California.

The California cannabis marketplace is seeing a shortage right now, so producers have the best context possible ‚Äì unless they aren‚Äôt in a position to expand production. NUGS, luckily for its shareholders, has been able to scale up to capitalize on the context and drive what looks to be a pretty dramatic topline growth acceleration.

Overall, the company‚Äôs April data showed an annualized pace exceeding $10 million in sales.

‚ÄúWe have never seen anything like this,‚Äù noted Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic Ventures. ‚ÄúWe booked $100,000 in one day to clear out all of our remaining inventory. We anticipated this dynamic but still underestimated the force of the trend. Too much demand is always the problem you want to have. And we are confident we will be able to translate this into further upside in terms of our top line growth curve.‚Äù

**Cresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF)** is another name recently on the move after a strong catalyst. In this case, the company announced the completion of its expansion project for cultivation and manufacturing at its facility in Brookville, PA. According to that release, the expansion project provides an additional 66,000 square feet of indoor and greenhouse cultivation area, bringing the total cultivation space in the facility to 88,000 square feet. Given the supply issues we are seeing across the country, this move promises to translate directly into a boost for top-line data in the months ahead.

This Chicago-based cannabis producer has seen its shares ramp over 100% higher off the March lows, and now sits back where it was in December, with $5/share orders up for grabs.

Cresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) frames itself as Cresco Labs Inc., together with its subsidiaries, cultivates, manufactures, and sells medical cannabis and medical cannabis products in the United States.

It offers cannabis in flower, live concentrates, vape, and liquid live resin under the cresco and Reserve brands; precisely-dosed and non-combustible products, including tinctures, capsules, salves, sublingual oils, and transdermal patches under the Remedi brand; culinary-backed under the Mindy‚Äôs Artisanal brand; fruity confections under the Mindy‚Äôs Kitchen brand; andpopcorn, shake, pre-rolls, and vapes under High supply brand. It also offers its products under Good News and Wonder brands. As of December 31, 2019, it operated 16 dispensaries in Florida.

And the stock has been acting well over recent days, up something like 21% in that time.

Cresco Labs Inc (OTCMKTS:CRLBF) pulled in sales of $54.6M in its last reported quarterly financials, representing top line growth of 143.9%. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($70.2M against $194.7M, respectively).

**Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA)** shares have been sprinting higher in recent days, helped perhaps by news that Aurora just bought up a CBD producer. Perhaps some folks were hoping that Canopy or Aphria might come along and put in a bid for MJNA given its positioning in the CBD space.

Good luck with that. This is not a company that‚Äôs going to seem clean under the hood after 20 years of chronic dilution and promotional hype. None of its financial data is regularly audited. And management has chosen to keep it on the pink sheets, where transparency and regulatory hurdles are set at the lowest bar.¬† So, on the M&amp;A front, we wouldn‚Äôt advise holding one‚Äôs breath.

Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) bills itself as an investment holding company that operates in the medical marijuana and industrial hemp markets.

Its products range from patented and proprietary based cannabinoid products to seed and stalk or isolated high value extracts manufactured and formulated for the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical industries. The company licenses its proprietary testing, genetics, labeling and packaging, tracking, production, and standardization methods for the medicinal cannabinoid industry.

It engages in the research and development of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals; and marketing and distribution of cannabidiol hemp oil-based products. In addition, the company provides management support and services to cooperatives, collectives, health and wellness facilities, and medical clinics; and consulting and securities services to businesses and individuals in the legal cannabis industry. Medical Marijuana Inc (OTCMKTS:MJNA) generated sales of $16.9M, according to information released in the company‚Äôs most recent quarterly financial report. That adds up to a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rate of -4.5% on the top line. In addition, the company is battling some balance sheet hurdles, with cash levels struggling to keep up with current liabilities ($6.2M against $11M, respectively)."	Why MJ Stocks are Back in Gear (GRWG, NUGS, CRLBF, MJNA)	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gnur45/why_mj_stocks_are_back_in_gear_grwg_nugs_crlbf/
DavidBoyer	1590058469	" [https://www.journaltranscript.com/2020/05/the-pot-stock-surge-why-sgmd-could-be-next-up/](https://www.journaltranscript.com/2020/05/the-pot-stock-surge-why-sgmd-could-be-next-up/) 

 

The cannabis theme has started to spring back to life in recent weeks, with top traded names in the space up anywhere from 50-100% in the past two months in a move that has all the hallmarks of a new pot stock bull market trend starting to take root.

Given that many names have already run significantly higher in this initial burst, one primary object of analysis in front of us now will be the search for strong stories in the space that have yet to catch fire. One by one, these lesser known cannabis stocks will get found and driven higher. You can bank on that.

In that spirit, we wanted to take a close look at a stock that just may perfectly fit the bill as an excellent candidate for precisely just such a move: Sugarmade Inc (OTCMKTS:SGMD).

The key components we are looking for here are rapid revenue growth, deep value in terms of price-to-sales multiple on a forward sales basis, and an interesting thematic factor that suggests the stock may get popular on trading boards and chats once it starts to show some life.

SGMD has all the makings of a rising star along those lines.

**Topline Growth and Value**

Sugarmade Inc (OTCMKTS:SGMD) bills itself as a product and branding marketing company investing in operations and technologies with disruptive potential. The company‚Äôs portfolio includes CarryOutsupplies.com, SugarRush‚Ñ¢ and Budcars.com.

Right now, the big story for the company is its BudCars business. It has two Sacramento hubs and just announced an imminent expansion into the LA regional market with its first LA hub set to ramp up in July.

The company‚Äôs primary locations in the Sacramento area have been experiencing dramatic growth, with revenues consistently increasing 10% week-over-week, driven by exploding demand for contactless delivery of cannabis products due to the coronavirus lockdown. The company now expects to surpass $30 million in annualized revenues at these locations.

‚ÄúOur Sacramento locations will pass the $10 million mark for annualized sales within the next 60-90 days,‚Äù stated Jimmy Chan, CEO of Sugarmade. ‚ÄúThe growth has been so dramatic that we have had to drastically revise our expectations to the upside, which demands expansion, both in terms of staff and fleet in Sacramento, and in terms of regional expansion into Southern California. As a result, we are acquiring two distribution hub locations in the LA area with cannabis licenses included so we can hit the ground running.‚Äù

That forms the context. But even ahead of the LA expansion, SGMD is seeing massive growth from BudCars on an organic basis. To wit: the company just announced record growth data during the month of April, with sales growing 58% on a sequential monthly basis over March sales on an average daily volume basis. In addition, data for the month of May already show a strong continuation of that trend, with May sales on pace to add another 16% over and above the strong breakout sales trend seen in April.

‚ÄúWe did about $6,000 per day in sales in March and over $9,500 per day in April, representing a very robust growth trend at our Sacramento hub,‚Äù notes Chan. ‚ÄúMay is already off and running at better than $11,000 per day, demonstrating continued dramatic growth. And investors should also note that this $11,000 per day figure represents activity in only one area. With our LA hub set to come online at the start of summer, and with the unprecedented stay-at-home extension in that region, we believe our daily sales in the LA area could triple that figure relatively quickly.‚Äù

So, the growth is through the roof. But the stock is trading on a market cap of just $2.8 million. Hence, in forward terms, this thing is trading at well under 0.2x sales, which is unheard of the cannabis space. We typically see deep value cannabis multiples in the 1.5x-2.5x area, and most of them are more commonly above 8x. That would mean SGMD shares could rally 1000% and still seem underpriced relative to peers.

**The Cannabis Delivery Theme is Budding**

The growth in the delivery space for cannabis has been astonishing this year. And BudCars is a great example of that trend. Certainly, the pandemic lockdown has helped to drive that trend. But it only accelerated a movement that has been underway for a while.

Analysts now project cannabis delivery to top $10 billion in sales, making it perhaps the fastest growing sub-sector in this ramping overall theme.

As cannabis shortages fester in California and people worry about public spaces due to risks of infection, a cannabis delivery company with rock solid supplier relationships stands to benefit in a few ways.

According to the company, ‚ÄúManagement notes that the California cannabis market is beginning to run into widespread shortages as demand surges over recent weeks. The Company wishes to assure shareholders that it has extremely strong supplier relationships and sees low risk of any issues in securing forward product inventories. Furthermore, as the Company‚Äôs competitors run into potential issues in securing their own inventory for distribution, management believes BudCars will likely see market share gains, providing another potential driver for near-term sales growth.‚Äù

In other words, this is a market share opportunity, which stands to double up the growth trend ‚Äì the whole cannabis delivery theme is growing rapidly, and the lion‚Äôs share of that market is set to be eventually divided up between the leading brands, who may just be the services able to expand without a hiccup during this supply shortfall while stay-at-home demand soars.

SGMD is positioned to take advantage, especially since the company is getting ready to open multiple hubs in the Los Angeles market, which is the biggest single municipal market for cannabis sales on the planet ‚Äì and expansion that the company expects to add a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù $40 million on the top line on an annualized basis."

# Banks ‚Äì

**Chase:**

Chase bank is a Fortune 500 company that will pay you a **$200** bonus for opening a checking account with a referral link and making a **direct deposit of** **any amount (EVEN JUST $1).**

A ""direct deposit"" is money that is deposited into your account directly from your employer‚Äôs payroll. If you do not receive these, I suggest doing a few minutes of work on Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk crowd-work platform and having your earnings sent to your Chase account via direct deposit.

**Stash:**

The app will ask you to open a paid account, but you can simply open a ""beginner"" account for $1 a month, and then close your account after 1 month after you get your $20 bonus.

**Qapital:**

Qapital is a banking app that pays you a $20 bonus for making at least a $20 deposit from any source. You need to set up a savings goal and a rule to automatically transfer funds to Qapital (One easy option would be to set up a $5 weekly transfer so that you can quickly qualify for the bonus). They have a monthly fee (Qapital Basic is $3/month; Qapital Complete is $6/month; and Qapital Master is $12/month.) which is waived for the first month.

If you keep your account open for 45 days, maintain a $20 account balance, and make 1 membership payment, they will credit you with a $20 account bonus. You can then immediately close the account and take your deposit + the bonus out with no additional charges.

AllOutMovies	1590443728	"\*Note\* - I originally posted this in r/Daytrading but thought it'd be relevant here as well.

I wanted to preface that this research is my own and solely based off my experience. I am not a financial advisor NOR would ever tell you to make trades based on my recommendations. I love talking about trading and the stock market and just wanted to share my input and the reasoning behind it.

This watchlist also does not include stocks that will be gapping up tomorrow morning due to earnings, news, etc. So I will be watching those as well if the setup presents itself and the stocks I have here may actually end up doing nothing.

A little bit about how I trade. I draw out validated levels of support and resistance on the daily chart. This stuff becomes second nature to do once you‚Äôve been doing it for a long time. I look for at least 3 good highs/lows from historical daily candlesticks that share the same price point as good levels of support and resistance. I‚Äôll even switch to the weekly chart for extra validation. Once I‚Äôm done drawing out the support/resistance on the long-term charts, I switch over to the quick charts. These support/resistance levels are reflected on the quick charts. I use the 3-minute and 1-minute chart to make my entries when a candlestick is approaching a daily support level. **This was my risk is low and my reward is significantly higher.** The closer my stop is to my support, the better. But I don‚Äôt just jump in. I wait for validation. How did the current candlestick react to that support level? Did it close above it? Was the last candlestick a dragonfly doji stick which can be a bullish reversal? I usually jump in when the first candlestick from the support level makes a new high. This kind of setup requires a lot of patience and determination in your analysis. I hardly ever chase due to fomo because I know that‚Äôs not consistently viable in day trading. But back to the stocks for tomorrow.

Here are the stocks that I think have potential based on the daily chart. If there‚Äôs enough volume and if most of them can break the previous day‚Äôs high, I think they all have gap up potential and will give opportunities to make money. Whether it holds up the entire day is a whole other story and they very well could be quick pump and dumps. But again, volume is so key. If the stock doesn‚Äôt move, all of this is pointless.

ACB: The $15.70 area is a validated level of support on the daily chart. If the stock can hold above that during pre-market or approach it during regular market hours, it has potential for a move higher. If it can then break the previous day‚Äôs high of $16.89, even better. The next level of daily resistance I see is at $19.68. But there‚Äôs a mini-resistance level around $17.25 area as well.

TTPH: Major support around $2.55. If it can hold, with enough volume, next level of daily resistance is the $3.06 area. Plus this resistance level also correlates with the 200-day simple moving average which is a study indicator I have on my daily chart.

XTNT: Support around $1.50. If it can stay above it and break the previous day‚Äôs high of $1.63, there‚Äôs a small window to make some profit. The 200-day sma is nearing above, but if it can break through it, could see it going higher.

BLIN: Support around $1.75. Below that, $1.60. If it holds above $1.60, can see it go back to $1.75 (because once previous support gets broken, old support becomes new resistance). If it can hold $1.75, can see it going to $1.95.

APDN: Daily support around $10.80. If it can hold, next level of resistance is $11.40 and then $12.00.

XELB: Support at $0.80. A hold above that and if it can break previous day‚Äôs high of $0.88, can see it going to around $1.00

ZYNE: Support at $6.35. Next level of resistance at $7.00

SNCA: Simply looking for a relief bounce. Support at $0.88. Next level of resistance then at $0.95. Not much of a play but still thought I should draw it out.

IBIO: This one‚Äôs a bit difficult. There‚Äôs like a cup and handle setup forming on the daily chart but not ideally the way I want it. If there is any potential, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll be tomorrow. Could very well come down but see a scenario for it going higher too. Won‚Äôt make a call on this until I see a few more candlesticks."

RotMGMeliorus	1590437661	"I will lay out why I'm extremely bullish on $BNGO for the coming days. They are presenting on 5/27 for a COVID conference and there is speculation of what could come before, during, or shortly after. First, we could get news on some form of acquisition from Quest. https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bionano-Corporate-Overview-April-2020_highest.pdf. See slide 8. Given Quest's acquisition history, https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/09/quest-diagnostics-history-of-acquisitions-is-payin.aspx, it certainly is a possibility. Nobody has PR'd this but we do know for sure that Quest has publicly evaluated Bionano's Saphyr. https://sec.report/Document/0001140361-20-006739/. 



Onto the COVID conference. Grandomics was one of the first to use Bionano's tech and they are at the epicenter of the Wuhan outbreak, conducting large studies. They are using Bionano's tech for this study, https://twitter.com/GrandOmics/status/1237574443829846021?s=20. 



There are more questions I have to ask myself and all of you. Does their unit (Saphyr) find SV's (structural variations) that others miss? Can it replace traditional Cytogenetics methods? If not, why did both Perkinelmer and Mayo Clinic adopt it recently? https://bionanogenomics.com/press-releases/bionano-genomics-announces-adoption-of-its-saphyr-system-by-clinical-cytogenetics-groups-in-academia-and-industry-to-replace-traditional-methods-for-clinical-testing/. The tech is good and complements PacBio and Illumina nicely. I believe a buy-out is just a matter of when not if.



Even if nothing big drops in the short-term (which I think some PR will), there is a conference coming and hype and momentum will drive the price on its own. Buying the rumor is the most important thing I've learned. Unconfirmed news is the best news."

Would you pass up on the very possible opportunity to make tens of millions of dollars? Would you trust somebody who claims to be passing up on such an opportunity just so they can teach you their ""trading strategy"" and make far less money?

I wouldn't. But this is exactly what Cam is doing, and anybody else who has the same ""$1k to a million in x days"" challenge. Its just a marketing strategy, they are only paper trading. Their real profits come from the over priced courses they sell.

How do I know this? Because, if they claim to have made 1,000x profit in a few months, ""turning 1k into 1 million"", why would they pass up on the opportunity to turn those $1m into 10 or 100 million? In effect, their ""challenges"" are causing them to miss out on potential profits of tens of millions. So are these astute, highly skilled traders very stupid with their finances? Or are they smart but manipulative marketers?

Now some of you might think, well its hard to play with millions of dollars in the penny stocks game, and that is their niche, so they have keep their money small. This is true, however they can easily apply their skills to bigger cap stocks. Its not very hard for a highly succesful penny stock trader to start trading large caps, and make a lot more money. But they won't, why? Because those who have the money to trade those types of stocks, the seasoned traders, know better. He would not get a single customer from that base, this is why he targets you, the $1k investor, the newbie, the one that can easily fall for these type of overpriced courses."

boccherini-trader	1590418951	" Stock prices were propelled upward last week due to two key announcements. Last Sunday, Jerome Powell¬†said the central bank still has plenty of ammunition to help the markets and economy. Then, Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) announced positive data on their COVID vaccine on Monday morning. This combination of news drove the S&amp;P 500 increase by 3.2% over the course of the week. With all this good news, can we expect more? Here are the details:

1. **On Sunday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the Fed is not out of ammunition 'by a long shot', driving premarket trading.** Last Sunday, on ""60 Minutes,"" Jerome Powell told the interviewer that ""we're not out of ammunition by a long shot,"" referring to a large sum of unused funds that have been allotted to fight COVID. Simply put, Powell plans on continuously infusing money into the economy to attempt to save small business from closing and permanently reducing the number of jobs available. Index futures traded significantly higher the same night.¬†¬†
2. **The next morning, Moderna released positive interim P1 data for their COVID vaccine, pushing stocks further upwards.** The morning after, Moderna announced positive data on their COVID vaccine. The biotech company demonstrated generation of anti-COVID antibodies in patients without significant side effects. The company plans on starting their pivotal P3 clinical trial in July, which, if successful, will lead to a much faster economic recovery with everyone's concerns of infection put at ease.
3. **On Thursday, over 2M Americans filed unemployment claims, but investors remain optimistic over economic reopening.**¬†As usual, the announcement of an additional 2.4M Americans filing for unemployment claims did not shake the market. Through our small sample size of consumer research, we have found that many are not working because of high unemployment benefits during COVID. Restaurants are worried about reopening because there may not be enough supply of workers to hire from in order to reopen their shops successfully. While more continue to file for unemployment claims, investors are confident that many will be able to sustain on government support and will reengage with the economy as it reopens.¬†
4. **To date, all but three states have either reopened to a degree or plan on reopening soon.** The final three states that have yet to open and do not have set plans to open are Illinois, Delaware, and New Jersey. As the weather gets better, more people are out and about waiting for takeout at their favorite local restaurants and eating the food in grassy public areas. So far, the U.S. government has not identified any spikes in COVID cases in states that have reopened.¬†
5. **With states reopening and the weather improving, airport travel jumps to a two-month high, indicating economic activity.**¬†With summer around the corner and COVID concern dying down, travelers are getting back into the air. This Friday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recorded a two-month high in airport travelers. While this number is still down 88% from a year ago, increase in air travel demonstrates confidence in ability to combat COVID.

**With the Feds' confidence in the economy and Moderna's exciting vaccine announcement, where does that leave the markets?**¬†WX Capital was confident that positive news would outweigh negative news in May, but now that positive news is relatively commonplace, we believe the market may recover at a much slower pace. We expect a successful economic reopening with limited spikes in COVID cases and believe that vaccine development for COVID is more of a matter of when rather than if. We also believe that biotech will likely be the industry with the greatest return potential in the near future."	5/25/2020: Weekly Wrap-up &amp; What to Expect	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gqch5b/5252020_weekly_wrapup_what_to_expect/

ParcelPal seamlessly connects consumers to businesses, where they have access to the goods they love, anytime, anywhere. Customers can shop at partner businesses and through the ParcelPal technology receive their purchased goods **within an hour** or **the same day.** The Company offers on-demand delivery of merchandise from leading retailers, restaurants, medical marijuana dispensaries and liquor stores in Vancouver, Calgary, Saskatoon and soon in major cities Canada-wide. 

#### TL;DR

Uber for everyday goods, i.e. clothes, condoms, flowers, medical marijuana, alcohol delivered within 1h. Currently: covering three areas in Canada.

---

## Some DD

ParcelPal (PP) currently *only* covers three areas in Canada. They are small, but imo they do it right. PP increased its sales by 75% in November 2019 and reported record sales for January 2020 ‚Äì it's likely PP is gonna break even soon. In addition, PP recently completed an non-brokered private placement worth up to USD $367,500.

PP is expanding to Canada and some areas in the United States soon. *(They already have a relationship and business with Amazon by delivering for them in Washington State since late 2018.)*

Since COVID19 hits the world at its weak point, PP is still doing pretty good because it meets people's needs at the right time. Delivery is growing rapidly worldwide. At this time, 471 jobs are listed on their ""Careers"" page. PP expanded and closed various partner businesses during the COVID19 pandemic: i.e. delivery of masks and COVID19 supplies, including test kits.

Currently the company‚Äôs management and other insiders are subject to a trading blackout, because of a **postponed filing** its audited financial for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to logistics and delays **caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.** PP is expected to publish the report before June 13, and is likely to exceed expectations again. - So it looks promising for the next few days.

#### TL;DR

Aggressive expansion in Canada and some US areas; 471 open jobs. Revenues and records have risen steadily since the end of 2019. High delivery demand due to COVID19. Increasing partner and special supply contracts to combat COVID19, i.e. delivery of masks and test kits within 1 hour.

UDUNN0JACK	1590388527	"First time posting... ever., thought I would contribute some much needed speculation to this group. (Long Rant) 

Many posts I see on this sub proclaim ‚Äúto the moon!‚Äù, or, should be worth at least $X by product release / earnings. This is based on a parroted claim that is spread due to this community‚Äôs herd mentality and no desire to do proper DD. 

I have been watching over the past month and I have seen multiple people that have mentioned bag holding previous P&amp;D stocks that may not see profit for weeks (minimum).

Penny Stocks are NOT long term holds. If you think that this stock has AMAZING potential and (FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON) no other investor has figured it out yet... let me break your bubble. It has no long term potential other than the FOMO fueled masses. This is what you need to capitalize on as a penny stock trader. 

Sure it may have been worth $1 pre-Covid. But that does not mean it has $1 potential anymore. Many of these stocks were worth $50+ pre-Covid but have been on a constant decline for many years. 

Sure, maybe there are those stocks that will explode. Most recently I can think of $NNDM. But, you have to ask yourself, did you buy in under $1 or did you ride the hype after and end up buying at $3.50 / share? If you bought in pre $1, then you either did proper DD, got lucky, or a combo. 

Personally, I don‚Äôt buy into any penny‚Äôs above $1 unless I think I can make +30% profit within a week. I‚Äôm not saying I haven‚Äôt been a bag holder (currently holding FRSX at $1 / share) but I understood the risks and I bought this in my IRA account, so worst case scenario I have to hold these until I retire (or the company becomes no more). I am mid 20‚Äôs for those curious.

Don‚Äôt accept anything I say as blind advice. Do your research and make decisions for yourselves. If your decision is to follow the herd, then don‚Äôt complain if you‚Äôre bag holding. 

To end this long rant on an optimistic note, let me first start by saying that NASA has not sent men to the moon since 1972 (that‚Äôs almost half a century ago!). Why do you think you can go to the moon when astronauts have given that up long ago?

Maybe we should set our sights on Mars instead? üöÄüöÄüöÄ

GNUS - Loading up whenever it dips and hoping it climbs plenty by Earnings (6/5) or channel launch (6/15)

DCAR - The cash in my account only settles Wednesday so I had to forget about buying some Friday/Tuesday, sadly. I think chances are slim that DCAR doesn't crash by Wednesday open.

XSPA - Gonna try to resist temptation and see if price slowly settles down by Friday. I'm betting on a cycle of good news spikes followed by slow, steady drops.

Ive learned to aim for 10% over (with brokerage included) then gtfo. Once I started that I started actually making money. Don't look for home runs. Get your gains and get out.

On this sub alone theres always atleast 5 symbols mentioned thatll go up or down 15% in that day. That's how you make money off of pennys. Gotta keep moving. For me 9.95 a trade means I need at least $20 to break even. once I hit 10% I get out.""

# Banks ‚Äì

**Chase:**

Chase bank is a Fortune 500 company that will pay you a **$200** bonus for opening a checking account with a referral link and making a **direct deposit of** **any amount (EVEN JUST $1).**

A ""direct deposit"" is money that is deposited into your account directly from your employer‚Äôs payroll. If you do not receive these, I suggest doing a few minutes of work on Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk crowd-work platform and having your earnings sent to your Chase account via direct deposit.

The app will ask you to open a paid account, but you can simply open a ""beginner"" account for $1 a month, and then close your account after 1 month after you get your $20 bonus.

[https://get.stashinvest.com/anton\_690shzk](https://get.stashinvest.com/anton_690shzk)

**Chime:**

Chime is a banking app that pays you a $50 bonus for making a direct deposit of at least $200. There is no catch, and you can close the account at any time fee free as soon as you register their debit card (gotta wait a few days to get it in the mail).

A ""direct deposit"" technically means that they want you to deposit the money right from payroll, but you can actually meet this requirement simply by transferring in $200 from CASH APP! So you could deposit $200 into cash app, then withdraw that $200 into chime and get the $50 bonus!

If you don't have cash app, you can also transfer in $200 from the following banks to fulfill the same requirements- Ally, Charles Schwab, Chase, Circle Pay App, Discover, Hancock Whitney, Huntington, PNC, Serve, TD Bank, USAA, US Bank, Wells Fargo.

[https://member.chime.com/join/antonmcclinton](https://member.chime.com/join/antonmcclinton)

**Qapital:**

Qapital is a banking app that pays you a $20 bonus for making at least a $20 deposit from any source. You need to set up a savings goal and a rule to automatically transfer funds to Qapital (One easy option would be to set up a $5 weekly transfer so that you can quickly qualify for the bonus). They have a monthly fee (Qapital Basic is $3/month; Qapital Complete is $6/month; and Qapital Master is $12/month.) which is waived for the first month.

If you keep your account open for 45 days, maintain a $20 account balance, and make 1 membership payment, they will credit you with a $20 account bonus. You can then immediately close the account and take your deposit + the bonus out with no additional charges.

DaveyOneBite	1590296618	"Thanks to promising research shared here, I scooped up a number of TLSS shares last week. Likely, many of you did the same.

Yesterday, I started to get the nagging thought that some of the news may be too good to be true. So rather then treating others' DD as facts, I decided to do a deep research dive myself.

First, looking into news &amp; files within the past 2 years which is the information most readily available on this company. Then, diving deeper and reviewing SEC files &amp; corresponding news from *before* they were a Transportation Logistics company and *before* the earliest dated news that is readily available on TLSS.

So far, I've found a number of concerns in my first phase of '&lt;2 years ago' analysis, but nothing that clearly derails the promising underlying growth story. Many of these may simply be 'all part of the game' when it comes to pink sheets.

The *earlier* time period analysis (\~2009 to \~2018) is much more unsettling. I can't imagine how some of what I am seeing, are not red flags.

I'll be sharing the results of my full extensive analysis once completed, but for I wanted to share an old blog post I just stumbled upon. It looks like they connected some of the same odd points/red flags I was seeing from the early years.

[Blog Post](http://promotionstocksecrets.com/petroterra-corp-ptra-from-the-ukraine-and-back-again/)

To summarize, and add on one more very red flag that happened since this post:

* What we know as TLSS today, first registered in late 2009 with the SEC Loran Connection Corp. A Ukrainian owned, Ukrainian tourism company.
* The initial auditor that they hired to analyze their filing would later have his license revoked for allegedly providing falsified reports for shell companies.
* Loran Connection Corp. remained active through 2010 &amp; 2011 with no revenue.
* In December 2011, the two Ukrainian executives sold their shares, and retired from the company, in lieu new players from California taking their place.
* Soon after, they moved the company to California, renamed to PetroTerra, and would re-focus on exploring general business investments in the US (with people suspecting it would soon look at Oil&amp;Gas specifically).
* Only a few months later, in Feburary 2012, they would sell of their shares, and retire from the company, in lieu of the very same Ukrainian re-taking her place as CEO.
* Soon after, she moved the company to Ukraine, kept the name as PetroTerra, but would re-focus the company back on Ukrainian Tourism.
* Petroterra, remained active through 2012 and most of 2013, with no revenue.
* In October 2013, the Ukrainian CEO sold off her shares, and retired from the company, in lieu of a different American (who she sold her shares to) taking her place as CEO.
* Soon after, he moved the company to Colorado, and would re-focus the company (officially) on U.S. Gas &amp; Oil Exploration.
* In November 2013, he would make a deal to sell 150,000 shares (valued at $0.001) for $0.50 or $75,000 to a non US individual.
* Later that month, he would make a deal with this same non US individual, paying him 1,000,000 shares in exchange for 6000 acres of oil &amp; gas land in Utah, that this individual had leased.
* This non US individual, was a Swedish banker, Antoine Ratsaphong.
* **Antonie Rataphong would later be criminally charged for involvement with Pump &amp; Dump scheme** around an unrelated company to PetroTerra.

\----------------------

That's all I got for now folks. Very suspicious if you ask me. 

But curious to get others' thoughts. Is the past the past and new management taking TLSS in a reputable and promising direction? But why would they be tied to this very odd company and not a new entity of their own?

I'll share more when I've made it through all my analysis and any oddities I may find.

**P.S.** This has been an extensive effort and there if still plenty more to go through and chase up a tree. I'm also not experienced in penny stocks so don't have any frame of reference for what is a red flag and what is 'all part of the game.

So, if anyone wants to join forces and help with some of the research, I'd gladly take it. Just shoot me a message."

My guess is that the R/S will be approved. The SP at that point will dip, with bagholders jumping ship, all day Friday.

The following Monday, the split will occur. Cue new traders coming in and asking where all their shares went.

After the split, the SP will begin a reversal looking forward to their quarterly earnings report. They're going to have a good report, with an estimated EPS of 0.40. I'm beginning to wonder if this might be a good entry Friday at the dip, making sure to buy in multiples of 5 to ensure I don't get cashed out at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Detecting **SARS COV2 viral particles in blood - which is what DECN claim to do** (and I should stress **I don't actually believe them**, here for reasons that I have made apparent in prior posts!) **- has largely ZERO diagnostic utility.**  
Only a small proportion of subjects with active infections (studies put the numbers at between 1 and 20%) show up an viral RNA in the blood. The apparent discrepancy in numbers (i.e as low as 1 % or as many as 20%) can be accounted for from the different populations tested in the various studies i.e. ICU vs hospitalised vs mild symptoms vs asymptomatic confirmed infections)  
Those that do show up virus particles in the blood are always symptomatic, showing well established infection that has progressed. In the unlikely event you have SARS COV2 in your blood, rather than just your mucosa - You already know you are sick! You are NOT an asymptomatic infectious spreader. You don't need a blood test to tell you that you are sick!. The pools of sweat and breathing difficulty you are experiencing may be a bit more of a clue, there!  
**So what DECN are claiming to have amounts to a test that** **may** **be capable of detecting upto \~20% of active infections - at best - while simultaneously misdiagnosing as 'clear'** **close** **to 100% of those with asymptomatic active infections, which are capable of being passed on to others.**  
That is clearly not merely useless. **Its actively harmful**  
**ZERO chance the FDA would EVER allow that to see the light of day!** And rightly so!"	Trying to get to the bottom of whether a blood test like DECN's would be able to detect an active infection.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gpbavm/trying_to_get_to_the_bottom_of_whether_a_blood/
Minds_Desire	1590262064	"I have been trading pennies for a little over a month now and I have come to the understanding that bagholding is rarely the right play to make in terms of actually progressing your account. I understand the concept of, ""you only lose when you sell"". But the inverse of this is also true, you only make money when you sell.

In addition to this, you are also losing the potential to make money while your money is stagnant in a position. I have held positions in such pump and dumps as DECN, UAVS, and MVIS. I am sure there are many more penny stocks that fall into this category. But while the idea that these stocks will experience the true potential that is perceived during the pump phase, there is a monumental amount of FOMO when it comes to holding one of these positions after the pump and dump period passes.

In summation, I am trying to fully rationalize why bagholding is the correct decision in a lot of these situations. While this makes a lot of sense in something like blue chip stocks that have very real value and history to back the position of holding those stocks, penny stocks rarely have this kind of rational evidence to hold these stocks after they have had their run."

mtmtrader	1590248079	"Stock breakouts create a ton of different trade opportunities for day traders, swing traders, and even investors using both long and short strategies. Still, they can also be pretty high-risk setups and many times cause inexperienced traders to buy at the very top of a move before it reverses back down. In this post I'll be explaining one of the proper ways to trade stock breakouts, which will help you avoid buying the top and will reduce risk when buying a breakout!

*First... what exactly is a breakout?*

A **breakout** is a move above a defined level of resistance. It's essentially the exact opposite of a breakdown, which is a move below a defined level of support. Unfortunately, many traders are taught to trade breakouts in a much less accurate way that creates a lot of unnecessary risk. This involves them buying immediately when a stock makes a new high over a past level of resistance. The problem with this breakout trading strategy is that it often leads to traders buying the top.

The reason for this is because of what are known as false breakouts. A **false breakout** is simply a short-term, temporary breakout over resistance that fails to continue upward. Any trader looking to immediately buy a breakout over resistance ends up buying the exact top of a move when it happens to be a false breakout. The breakout trading strategy that I'll be explaining in the rest of this post will help you avoid buying any false breakouts!

[https://imgur.com/a/cWvdaim](https://imgur.com/a/cWvdaim) 

Instead of immediately buying a breakout to new highs, you can substantially reduce your risk by waiting for the past breakout level, *or resistance,* to turn into **support**. As explained in past posts, broken resistance can become support, and broken support can become resistance. When a stock breaks above resistance, by waiting for that past resistance to become a level of support you're ensuring that you're not chasing the stock at its high during a false breakout. By trading breakouts this way you also now have a level of support to use for risk management. You can enter the trade knowing that your risk is limited because you'll cut losses if the stock comes back below its new support level.

[https://imgur.com/a/AmRFjt2](https://imgur.com/a/AmRFjt2) 

As you can see in the real life example below with the stock symbol $AMD, there was a breakout over a past high/past resistance level, and a long consolidation period over that past resistance, which then became a key level of support. There was plenty of time in this example to use that support as an opportunity to buy before it started its run to new highs. This happens much more commonly than you may think and can offer some incredible trading opportunities!

[https://imgur.com/a/VoK1nmZ](https://imgur.com/a/VoK1nmZ)

*Again,* using this breakout trading strategy will reduce your risk and will definitely reduce the amount of time that you catch yourself buying into a false breakout. The example of stock symbol $IMBI below shows you how dangerous it can be to buy into these false breakouts. $IMBI had resistance at $5.40 from the market's open, briefly broke above that resistance by only $0.03, came straight back down, and ended the day more than 20% lower than its early morning breakout level! By waiting for support to form over that $5.40 resistance, you'd be able to avoid buying into this false breakout trap.

[https://imgur.com/a/EtaUYFY](https://imgur.com/a/EtaUYFY) 

I hope this post was helpful for any new traders that find themselves buying the top of a move too frequently! This strategy should prevent that from happening and should greatly help you improve your accuracy when trading stock breakouts!

SBM_22	1590222225	The Norwegian Air Shuttle Company almost lost it all because of Covid-19, but here is 2 reasons to buy it: 1. The Chinese just bought around 20% of the company, and I doubt they would do that unless they were predicting a profit. 2. Here in the Scandinavian countries we have companies owned by the our State (f.x big infrastructure like aviation) which means that the State would be forced to build a new aviation infrastructure, if it were to fall. This is simply not a solution, because the cost of building a new aviation infrastructure would be to high. They are saying it is ‚Äúto big to fall‚Äù, so I believe it is gonna recover.

Long, mid, short? Personally, long to mid. I like this one a lot

What confirmation would it need to have a higher breakout to $2 target? Minimum 0.69+

It broke high after hours, should I get it premarket? Highly recommended to wait till how it performs the opening market and confirm around 9:30 am-ish to 10am.

Currently, many states are reopening into phase two. Phase two consist of movie theatres, restaurants, etc. Larger stocks such as sbux and McDs have already seen gains early on. Yet smaller stocks like Denn are still waiting to peak. 

Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a good buy; 

- Past 5 years constant growth 

- Beating its eps consistently

- does take out so it‚Äôs buisness is not totally hit

Planet 13 (OTC: PLNHF and CNX: PLTH)

Hey guys this is my first DD so sorry if there are some mistakes; I invite all criticisms. Always do your own DD, this is not stock advice, buy at your own discretion. Also, I‚Äôm not sure how you all feel about OTC stocks, I myself have been leery about buying such stocks, that said I really think there is something to Planet 13 (PLNHF).

[https://www.planet13holdings.com](https://www.planet13holdings.com)  (holdings website)

[https://www.planet13lasvegas.com](https://www.planet13lasvegas.com)  (Las Vegas store site)

What is it:

PLNHF is a cannabis company that operates in Las Vegas. They have the largest dispensary in the \*world\* conveniently located by the Las Vegas strip. Has both medical and recreational licenses. The dispensary is 16,200 sqft and is part of a large 112,000 sqft entertainment complet. It was voted the #1 Mary-J dispensary in Las Vegas. It does 9% of the total sales of cannabis in the state of Nevada. Regarding its name, the number 13 represents the 13th letter of the alphabet M, for marijuana.

What‚Äôs so special about it?:

I believe the Planet 13 is poised to become a market leader in the emerging market of cannabis. Planet 13 is a vertically integrated, meaning it owns its own its own supply chain (cultivating, processing and dispensing.) Investor presentations indicate an emphasis on the \*experience\* over products, this is evidenced by their expansive dispensary complex which has interactive stops, coffee shop, restaurants, and event space. In other words, Planet 13 has made its store a must go destination in LV. Think of it as a Disneyland for potheads.

Products: Outside of simple pot they also sell cannabis vaping products, candies/gummies/chocolates. They also sell planet 13 merch.

Numbers:

\-Total market cap of $200 million

\-In store and delivery sales of $63 Million in 2019

\-Q1 of 2020, a traditionally slow season, was up 20% from Q1 2019

\-At this time the company remains unprofitable. Net loss in 2019 was about $2.6 million and the company has about $12 million in net cash on hand. However I do expect this to change rapidly over the coming year as they expand their brand into other cities.

Advantages/Tailwinds:

\-As stated above, the dispensary is vertically integrated, meaning it owns its own supply chain. However they do sell other products from 3rd parties and these companies want to be on their shelves

\-It‚Äôs the closest dispensary to the strip, just a few minutes taxi ride or walk away. Las Vegas is a premier tourist destination, and \*the\* destination to go to for any number of debaucherous delights

\-Recently acquired Newtonian Principles, a dispensary in Santa Ana, California. Along with the company is a cannabis sales license for California. ([https://planet13holdings.mediaroom.com/2020-05-21-Planet-13-Announces-Acquisition-of-California-Dispensary-License-and-Close-of-Santa-Ana-Acquisition](https://planet13holdings.mediaroom.com/2020-05-21-Planet-13-Announces-Acquisition-of-California-Dispensary-License-and-Close-of-Santa-Ana-Acquisition))

\-Recently expanded fleet of delivery cares for the Las Vegas Valley area from 5 to 29 vehicles running 24/7

\-Scalable model ‚Äì plans are for expansion in large US cities. As noted above, California is the next target of expansion. The CEO has basically said if the city can support a major sports team they would like to expand there.

Disadvantages/Headwinds:

\-Before the COVID19 pandemic, 80% of customer base were from people who live outside of LV. They‚Äôve mostly turned to local sales since the shutdown. The demand remains high and they‚Äôve been able to keep most of their staff, a great sign.

\-Analysts downgraded forecast for the company in light of COVID19 effect on the company. Earnings expectations for 2020 are about $50 million, about 21% decline. This is however not reflected in stock prices which have proceeded to increase from a low of about $0.70, to about $1.20 today. The previously, analyst had forecasted revenue of $93 million. Obviously COVID19 is dramatically affecting business, as is the case with the general market.

\-Legalization is a big question mark. Currently marijuana is legal in only 11 states for adults over the age of 21, and legal for medical use for 33 states.

Conclusion:

Planet 13 is a rapidly growing company that has the promise of becoming a premier destination for marijuana by providing a unique experience designed to draw customers and itself become an attraction in any given city. COVID19 has hit the company hard, but I do believe that once people start going back to LV Planet 13 will be a big winner in the game."

(especially if you‚Äôre swing trading). Take a second before buying, and ask yourself, if you already owned the stock before it went up, would you sell? If you are thinking about selling, ask yourself if you would still buy. Leave the emotion and bags behind and remember to ‚Äúbuy low, sell high.‚Äù

Idk but u/Vivid_Mood seems suspicious.

His entire post against Prado was just about praising Chas and how good of a person he was.

We found out very recently that Chas has been deleting comments, posting fake info, and spreading rumors about others.

Almost all of the evidence that he provided against Prado is just showing how Chas was ‚Äúright‚Äù.

This is also fairly new account that has only a few posts and the only posts that Vivid has is just bashing Prado and praising Chas.

Also, Vivid has deleted most of his comments from his posts which is the exact same thing that Chas has done

Vivid is Chas‚Äôs alt account that he made to make himself look better and more credible."	Vivid_Mood Is Chas	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gsdpic/vivid_mood_is_chas/

I have already done some quick research. I know they are a media/toy company targeted at young children and they have a fairly successful show on Nick and new toys bla bla bla.  

They have also been around for awhile and have lost significant equity/money for 8 consecutive years. Seems like a spiraling company. However crazier things have happened and I can‚Äôt ignore the solid economic activity they have going on right now with the show and the toys.

I am a bagholder because I bought this stock just because I saw'' ferrari'' and got excited.

Now that I've been reading more and more about it I believe it can be a long term investment. I will not sell this stock for a loss since they are here to stay and their future seems bright, their ER also seem very positive with a lot of contracts.

preheat11	1590678740	"This is my case to buy Latam Airlines (LTM) while it almost hit its 52 week low today, and as of right now is not to far from it. So, I KNOW they filed for bankruptcy 2 days ago, bankruptcy can be a scary word but chapter 11 bankruptcy means that they plan on rebuilding and bouncing back. Here are some reasons to look into this stock:

1. LTM is South Americas largest carrier, and if you do not know, South America is a huge continent. 
2. They have also posted profits for the last four years without fail.
3. They plan on flying through this bankruptcy as well.
4. Delta Airlines is partnered with them and have a hefty 1.9 billion invested in them and they have said they will continue to support LTM through this bankruptcy period. 

Furthermore, South America is just more recently being effected by the virus than the United States. And the government of Chile has not bailed this company out (they said they would consider it) like the US government did for airlines here. LTM creates a lot of jobs for people in Chile and considering they are the biggest carrier in the entire continent, there could be a strong possibility the gov't helps them. We saw the rebound of airlines in the U.S. in a few months, we could see something similar here with LTM. Now would be the time to hop on for a short term swing in the next couple weeks or a long term hold for post virus where we could see this companies shares go back up past $10. I've done my DD before I posted this and I am not here to pump, please do your own DD before you buy, lot of articles to read."	LTM	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gs81df/ltm/

bighead-100	1587660791	Ok here is the scoop. Yesterday the Ohio Gov DeWine announce he is working a partnership with a finger prick company for contact tracing. He will announce today at 2 pm. Now Cali and Washington have jumped on the bandwagon with announcing the hiring of 10000 contact tracers each. These tracers will be doing a finger prick test. So there are only 90 companies that are seeking approval for this test. These companies all work in various forms in the blood glucose testing industry, The test is based off this platform. The need for tests is going to be in the tens of millions a week, unless we say screw the diabetics and switch all biosensor to covid no one company or shut 90 companies will be able to keep up with demand. DECN said they will be able to self certify the efficiency of the test and will be ready to rock in mid May. If Ohio Governor mentions any company of the 90 that are all going to be approved per FDA self certification guidelines then DECN should moon because they are a specialized biosensor company because they can manufacture a biosensor for every device out there.

If this test gets approved, there is no competitors. The value of a 15 second response time test without the use of reagents blows any other test out of the water. This will legit be a game changer and every single company in the world will be ordering these.

justasbadasyou	1587978378	"Ticker: DTEA

Description:

David‚Äôs Tea is out of Canada, which sells tea and tea accessories. DTEA started in 2008 and became a public company four years ago. DTEA currently has over 2,500 drugstore, grocery stores, and individual David Teas stores in just Canada selling David‚Äôs Tea products. DTEA will have the potential for future partnerships and more distributors, including more drugstore and grocery stores. Davids Tea has over 100 different teas and has the most extensive collection of organic teas in North America. DTEA allows people to take better care of their health, and the store associates are very knowledgeable, as well as the information given on their website where you can pur√©e different tea products. Tea is the second most popular drink in the world. DTEA was also ranked high in polling and research with customer satiation and quality products within Canada.


Potential 2019-2020 Catalyst 


-Heavenly focus on wholesale and online sales 
-Additional stores in the wholesale channel
-Expect an increase of teabags sales in early 2020
-Provide food products in stores
-Continuing to strengthen management team
-Product innovation 
-Continuing to enhance the customer experience in stores and online


Financials (as of Sept. 30th, 2019)


-Sales are down 10% from last year which could be the result of discounted tea and expensive inventory
-Wholesale and e-commerce sales are up 14% this quarter
-Cash burn is only 1.7 Million this quarter compared to 20.9 millionaire in Q3 of 2018
-28 million cash on hand
-Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.34; GAAP EPS of -0.42
-Revenue of 39.49M (-9.6% Y/Y)


Authors Take On Finances:


DTEA has taken steps to grow the company and hopefully become a profitable company. Sales in stores have decreased, but they have increased in e-commerce and wholesale channels, which could be a driving factor to produce a profitable company with greater online adoption and the increase in popularity in grocery chains.


Bull Thesis:


DTEA has the potential to reach their all-time high of $29.60, but they have a long way to achieve this. Insiders own most of the outstanding shares, and there have been no insider sales. Most insiders have purchased shares at high prices. The CEO (Joel Silver) purchased shares at $20.20 and owns about 50% of total outstanding shares.


Bear Thesis:


DTEA Reported that one of its significant expenses was a severance package, which is not good news. The stock also got recently downgraded by BidaskScore. The company also produces negative income for the past four years since going public. The in-store sales are down, and they will need to provide a solution to this problem. In Q3, DTEA discontinued much tea at 50-90% off, which possibly impacted the Q3 earnings. Also, having an Earnings Call late Friday without an announcement is not the best way to handle that, and I believe they gave a weak IR.


Authors Note:


DTEA is a high-risk stock, and we could see a further drop in stock price, but I believe this company has room to grow, and with their increase in e-commerce, grocery and drug chains carrying their products is positive. I think if they develop relationships with more companies or build partnerships and possibly release THC products or alcoholic drinks, we could see an increase in stock price. At the current closing price of $1.50 as of December 23rd, this stock could easily be used as a swing trade or long term hold."

Many on here are previous AYTU bag holders that perhaps sold for a loss or broke even and are now cursing the company like they stole their money and went bankrupt. Here is your lesson, be patient. 

AYTU

-Has a CEO that sold his last company valued at $1b

-Company on the NASDAQ

-Multiple products on the market that target various billion dollar markets

-Had a 500% increase in revenue from 2018 to 2019, totaling their revenue to near $50m due to mergers with two pharma companies (Cerecor &amp; Innovus)

-Currently has $60m cash on hand

-USA distribution license of two companies for COVID-19 rapid testing, one is a massive biotech chinese company. The other is also reputable and has various markings(CE, FDA philipines, HSA &amp; NMPA). Already confirmed order of 2.1m test kits.

-COVID-19 product has been delivered to customers - so it's not just orders or hopes that they'll be provided. Initial 100k test kits have already been distributed, while 500k are in USA pending clearance. This is not to include the 1 million that have been ordered and accepted by the manufacturer. 

-Worldwide distribution license of Healight, a medical device that can kill many viruses/bacterias including coronavirus via UV light. This is the first of its kind and has been in development since 2016, awaiting patent approval. We can expect some data/research on this very soon.

DECN

-Apparently has a COVID-19 product that is pending FDA approval/acknowlegement. We don't have any other details besides its supposedly ""perfect technology"" and takes ""10-15 seconds"". They expect to sell hundreds of millions of these kits.

It's an overgeneralization, I know, but the point is that up until now news hasn't seemed to have had any significant effect on AYTU's SP. 

Now it's different. This company is caught up in the middle of a political tug-o-war. Whether or not AYTU's UV-light thingy does what it says it does, or if their COVID-19 tests are as accurate as they are purported to be, this company has been elevated to the national spotlight. Their ability to produce a successful product is temporarily irrelevant to their brand. From being mentioned on Fox News on Friday, to this whole censorship debacle‚Äî*AYTU published a promotional video about their UV-light product on YouTube and because the mere existence of this UV-light treatment has the potential to refute the official narrative which casts the President's previously mentioned idea of using UV-light to treat COVID-19 as silly and ridiculous, The Peanut Gallery is invested in making sure they don't have egg all over their faces by reporting the video to YouTube and Twitter for ""content violations,"" which subsequently led to AYTU's Twitter account being suspended (and unsuspended and then resuspended, but I digress, I'm not really paying that close of attention to it). This has both the Red Gang and the Blue Gang up in arms on the internet battlefront. One side claiming the other side ""wants censorship because orange man bad"" and the other side claiming ""the UV-light treatment is disinformation designed to make orange man look good.""‚Äî*this is mostly likely only going to be good for AYTU's SP, regardless of what side you belong to (or if you just impale yourself on the middle-most fence post as I do).

Neither the company's efficacy nor their ability to produce profit is going to matter in the next few days. Public perception of AYTU is going to be the sole driving factor in its SP. And, as of right now, it definitely appears to me that the perception of AYTU is generally positive (full disclosure: this may be informed by my bias as I am holding about 2500 shares). I say this because I put stock in Joe Rogan's ability to affect the perception of both gangs and he recently retweeted someone griping about AYTU's recent battle with censorship to his 6+ million followers. To reiterate, AYTU is front and center right now and I contend most people have a positive perception about the company.

If I had to guess, I would say that we'll see AYTU go above $2 in the immediate future, and possibly up to or surpassing its 52-week high ($2.99) by the end of the week. And if the President tweets or mentions AYTU's name? Please know that I don't type this lightly: **to the frickin' moon!** (Ironically, a few weeks ago I read a comment on this sub which stated ""President Trump could tweet about AYTU and its SP would still go no where."" I laughed and enjoyed the satire, but who knows? Maybe we'll get to see what would actually happen.)

Once again, all of this could be just wishful thinking from an AYTU bag holder, but to elaborate more on my point of view: All of the information I have presented here comes from the viewpoint of a former journalist, trained at one of the top journalism schools in the country, who has practiced the bloodsport that is journalism for years. I'm still a noob as far as trading stocks goes, but I consider myself to be born out of the media lifecycle. One thing I know is my own kind."

ShitPostGuy	1587998663	"It was a warm spring Monday when the opening bell rang. I logged into Schwab to see how BBRW was faring. On the Friday before there had been significant level 2 trading by market makers which had kept the price low. I didn‚Äôt love it, but it was a necessary evil. When the big boys move, us small fish make money riding the waves. 

Everything seemed in order, volume was on pace for another record day, prices were climbing. But then IT appeared. A 10,000 share ask at 0.021. 

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúthat looks like some 10k shuffle shenanigans.‚Äù Surely the market makers had gotten their fill on Friday?

Being a follower of science, I decided to test my theory. I placed a bid for 10,000 shares at $0.020, higher than any other bid on the market, and waited and watched. It didn‚Äôt fill instantly like Schwab had warned me, it just sat there. 10 minutes went by and nobody had sold me their shares so I canceled my order.

I looked at the volume metrics once more. 100,000 shares had traded hands while my bid remained unfilled. Yet there it sat unchanged,the 10,000 share ask at $0.021, it‚Äôs perfectly even share count glinted mockingly. I watched the buy volume increase another 100k, yet still the ask would not die. $0.019 bids were stacking up below, up to 190,000 shares now, pleading to be filled. Yet the 10,000 share ask refused to budge.

SeriousTradesOnly	1587993418	"News Today:  PharmaCyte Biotech Successfully Completes Pyrogenicity Testing

PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc. is a biotechnology company developing cellular  therapies for cancer and diabetes based upon a proprietary  cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology known as  ‚ÄúCell-in-a-Box¬Æ.‚Äù This technology will be used as a platform upon which  therapies for several types of cancer and diabetes are being developed. 

 Technology May Be a Game Changer in Treating Pancreatic Cancer. 

Its  therapy for cancer involves encapsulating genetically engineered human  cells that convert an inactive chemotherapy drug into its active or  ‚Äúcancer-killing‚Äù form. Its therapy for Type 1 and 2 diabetes involves  encapsulating a human cell line that has been genetically engineered to  produce and release in-sulin in response to the levels of blood sugar in  the human body.

cgnSooner	1588364469	"Hey everyone, I'm so glad you all liked my idea and wanted to follow along. Well, after the first 24 hours we have Profit! I sold my 2 shares of TTI at $0.50 a piece for a total profit of $0.07. I then purchased 2 shares of VISL at $0.305, and then purchased 1 share of TTI at $0.46 meaning I had spent my entire $1.07. The rest of the day didn't go so well so I ended the day at a total value of about $1.04 so I will be holding both positions though the weekend and see what Monday brings. I know many of you wanted to try this yourself so you should be able to download the spreadsheet I made [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YCe8uIoA64fEsqvvttBlxkeABfeeik-N).

Cicero1982	1588356356	"Below you will find a summary of the company behind stock ticker $DFFN. The research is my own. The opinions and analyses expressed are my own and may not properly reflect the underlying conditions of this company or security. You should do your own due diligence. I am not a financial advisor. I am an amateur investor. 

Background: 

On 01 APR 2020 DFFN announced they teamed up with UVA Heath and iTHRIV to combat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 infection. They have begun talks with the FDA and ‚Äúwill issue public updates as warranted by this fast-moving situation.‚Äù After this announcement $DFFN share price went from $0.30 per share to $0.75 per share before settling at $0.40 per share. https://fintel.io/doc/sec-dffn-8k-diffusion-pharmaceuticals-2020-april-01-18353

On 27 APR $DFFN announced their pre-IND submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a planned clinical program using trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) in COVID-19 patients. Under federal regulations, the FDA has up to 60 days to hold an advisory meeting with the Company, but for COVID-19-related submissions, the FDA has announced its intention to significantly shorten this period under its Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. Clinical trial start-up preparations are continuing as the Company awaits the FDA‚Äôs response. 
To aid in timely trial enrollment, Diffusion is conducting expedited discussions with institutions located in areas of severe COVID-19 incidence, both in the U.S. and in Eastern Europe, to determine their possible participation. As a result $DFFN share price went from $0.45 per share to $0.85 per share before settling and holding at $0.50 per share until 30 APR. https://fintel.io/doc/sec-dffn-8k-diffusion-pharmaceuticals-2020-april-29-18381

Analysis :

Before the end of May DFFN will likely announce the FDA‚Äôs response to their request to begin the trial. While most traders are thinking of the FDA response many neglect to think of the European response. Therefore there may be two catalysts here. Much like recent submissions for other drug companies for COVID-19 related cases, it is highly likely they will receive an answer within the month of May. It is also highly likely that they will be given a fast track status. As TSC has had no ‚Äúnegative safety findings‚Äù or ‚Äúserious adverse events‚Äù in their glioblastoma trial, they should be able to move directly into phase 2 trials. If they receive the FDA‚Äôs blessing DFFN share price will likely gap up and settle in the $0.60‚Äôs. As DFFN does not have a partner to help finance most of the trials for TSC it should not settle much higher than $0.75 at the most. The good news is that the potential high profile visibility that this trial offers will likely bring to DFFN to the attention prospective big-pharma partners.

https://investors.diffusionpharma.com/News/news-details/2020/Diffusion-Pharmaceuticals-Evaluating-TSC-Against-Acute-Respiratory-Distress-Syndrome-ARDS-in-COVID-19-Patients/default.aspx

Possible Catalysts:

1. Announcement of submission to FDA (Complete)
2. More info during ER (Possible date listed below)
3. Approval by FDA
4. Fast Track Designation
5. Grant Money or Financial Partner
6. Progress updates
7. Submission to FDA for advancement
8. Approval by FDA to advance
9. Progress updates
10. Submission for FDA Approval
11. FDA Approval
12. Marketing and distribution
13. A partner to market and distribute TSC

Possible Risks: 

1. Shorts love $DFFN (Clay Traders, Sabby Management owns 5%). With news pending the chance shorts will have a significant impact on share price is low to moderate. 
2. Reverse Split: On 17JUN2020 shareholders will vote to give DFFN the authority to initiate a reverse split.  DFFN has until 24AUG2020 to regain compliance (Share Price above $1.00). A reverse split will likely happen between 01JUL &amp; 24AUG if the COVID/ARDS trials do not propel DFFN share price above $1.00 per share for at least 10 days. https://fintel.io/doc/sec-dffn-diffusion-pharmaceuticals-def-14a-proxy-statement-2020-april-29-18382
3. Public Offering: Their last offering was in December and they have enough money to get them to Q1 2021. However last quarters financial estimates did not include the ARDS trial. No doubt they will get grant money, particularly with their partners at UVA. However if they do not have a partner to finance them in their other 3 trials expect another offering at the next couple of catalysis (Low to moderate chance) before July or amid catalysts after July (Highly likley). Good news is their last offering was priced $0.10-15 cents above market value. It is possible but unlikely they will dilute their shares again with the security trading at its current price.
4. FDA fails to approve the ARDS trial: Low Risk as there are no safety issues, they currently have three trials underway, and TSC is shown to work on Hypoxic Tumors in their Glioblastoma trial. 

Other Trials
-Phase 3 Glioblastoma Trial: Underway and showing promising results. 
-Phase 2 Stroke trial: training first responders (slowed due to  COVID-19)
-Phase 2 Pancreatic Cancer Trial (interacting with the USFDA regarding design of a clinical development)

Observation: Will likely get bought out by big pharma before making it to marketing. 

Revenue potential for TSC: (tens to hundreds of billions)

Patents: US &amp; Europe (patent portfolio ranging through 2031 with possible extensions to 2036¬† In addition Orphan Designations in the brain cancers, add an additional 7 years of exclusivity there.)

Investment Strategy 

Buy under $0.51 if you‚Äôre going long. Set your alerts. Decide how much money you want to commit. Build small position. Average down slowly with an equal sized position each penny or half penny it drops until you have the amount of shares you want to invest (should take days or weeks, not hours but best get in before the news). Be prepared to average down beyond your base position if necessary, but sell the excess you used to average down with for a small profit on the pops and short squeezes. This will not only increase your average down capital, but also pay for part of your position and give you peace of mind. If you‚Äôre a short term in and out penny flipper you‚Äôre destined to hold bags. The goal is to average down to the lowest possible price while selling excess shares on the pops with a permanent base position that will explode on news.

Important Reminder: $DFFN will need a partner to help fund, complete, and market TSC. No partner likely means no drug. No partner also likely means more offerings. A financially backing partner is the single biggest catalyst this security will experience!

Analysts price targets: I‚Äôve seen estimates from $1.50-$3.50 per share.

Institutional Ownership

https://fintel.io/so/us/dffn

Commonly asked question: Why has the stock price dropped so far?
Answer: Past reverse splits, offerings, and short attacks. All risks addressed above. Although I personally have paid for 100% of my DFFN position by averaging down and selling the excess on the pops. (See investment strategy above). 

Important Dates:

1. Shareholder meeting on June 17, 2020 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, by means of a live webcast
2. Earnings Report 5 May to 15 May 2020 (Unconfirmed)
3. Reverse Split likely JUL-AUG 2020 if not in compliance.
4. Offerings are highly likely after July to help fund FY2021

My criticisms and questions of $DFFN: 

1. They‚Äôve been partner hunting for years. Where is the partner? Where are they in finding a partner? Are they ever going to stop diluting shareholder equity? Diffusion Pharma has destroyed their own stock and the money of their investors to pay the bills on what looks like an incredibly slow and foot dragging endeavor. For much if not all of their staff this is a second endeavor in addition to their career. A kind of ‚Äúother source of income.‚Äù I question their urgency to develop TSC and bring it to market. They have a lot less incentive than their shareholders do in my opinion. 
2. Stage two Stroke trial is delayed because they couldn‚Äôt train first responders in time before the COVID-19 outbreak. I believe it shouldn‚Äôt have taken this long to train first responders.
3. Diffusion Pharma usually releases news about once a month. Twice on a good month. Much to the anger of their shareholders who would like more regular updates.  
4. The CEO is asking for a vote on a pay raise for him and his partners who own very little of their own stock. I believe their compensation should be tied to their performance on advancing their pipeline over the last year and advancement in their share price. This of course means an increase in pay should be certainly out of the question! At this time they live exclusively off of shareholders and from what I can tell their tenure at DFFN is a side job for many of them. 

Worst Case Scenario:

- Worst case scenario is that the owners and staff at DFFN care nothing about finding a partner and are just robbing the shareholders through offerings to advance their drug and pay themselves a secondary income on their side hustle. They will complete a number of reverse splits and offerings between now and FDA approval as the money they stand to lose on their own shares pale in comparison to the money they pay themselves through shareholder benevolence and the money they stand to make when they advance this drug down the road. (No evidence of this but looking at the possible worst case scenario.

Best Case Scenario

- Diffusion Pharmaceuticals announces a partner within the next three months. They also announce in the next two weeks that they have attained FDA approval to begin their ARDS trial. The FDA grants fast track status to the ARDS trial. Diffusion Pharmaceuticals also announces that they are back on track for the stroke trial and have fully completed training of first responders 3-6 months from now. DFFN comforts their shareholders by telling them they have plenty of money as a result of their new partnership and will not do another offering in the next one to two years.

What‚Äôs my motivation for posting this?

1. A month ago the trading value of $DFFN skyrocketed 150% on news that they were in talks with the FDA on the COVID-19 related ARDS trial. Many penny chasing investors got in too late. They are now holding bags waiting for the next news to arrive. The current trading value is hanging roughly around 30% above where it was before April 1st. 
2. With COVID-19 in the news $DFFN may be a seriously profitable speculative play if you get in before the buzz.
3. Knowledge sharing from lessons learned trading $DFFN
4. Peer Review on my $DFFN investment to become a better trader and analyst

phantomBlurrr	1588354533	"$TBLT

About a month ago, this stock was worth around $0.14-$0.15 per share. They had a 10:1 reverse split in order to bump up the cost per share and avoid delisting from the exchange. At the moment, the cost per share is fluctuating around $1.2-$1.3.

As far as news goes, all I really know is that they reported positive numbers on their last earnings report and apparently they've been making decent profits on Amazon market.

I'm also aware that they have a business contract with Lowe's which is expected to come into effect in October. The contract mentioned something like $20M, TBLT branded products supposed to enter Lowe's ecosystem and they're also supposed to handle some of Lowe's own product under the Cobalt brand.

If you have any other news about this stock (or Lowe's since that would have some effect) let everyone know!

I'm planning to hold this stock until mid October and at that point sell it all if there's no positive change."	I hereby declare this post as the $TBLT megathread.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbmjiq/i_hereby_declare_this_post_as_the_tblt_megathread/

**Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:**

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) √∑ Shareholders‚Äô Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Palatin Technologies is:

40% = US$37m √∑ US$91m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2019).

The ‚Äòreturn‚Äô is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders‚Äô equity, the company generated $0.40 in profit.

quickups123	1588347102	"I am looking for opinions on whether my plan is worth pursuing with the following stocks that I currently own.

Currently holding VISL, MVIS, TTI.

VISL:
200 Shares
0.35 Average Cost

MVIS:
100 Shares
0.40 Average Cost

TTI:
100 Shares
0.50 Average Cost

I plan on either selling 100 shares of VISL at 0.70 and continue holding or sell all 200 shares before their conference call on May 8th.

I plan on selling all 100 shares of MVIS before their conference call on May 7th.

I plan on selling all 100 shares of TTI if it reaches 0.70.

My only real concern is whether these scheduled conference call dates are legit because when reading through various posts, there seems to be a mixed bag of comments of when each company is holding a scheduled conference call."

Fridaysgame	1588346279	"I've been mentioning this stock in a few threads recently, and a lot of people have asked why?A quick disclosure: I hold a medium size position in [CTX.TO](https://CTX.TO), purchased in mid-April at $0.47 per share. It currently sits at $0.70 per share, where I feel it still hold a lot of long term value.

* **Fundamentals are solid** \- P/E about 8 (ttm 5), P/S ans P/B under 0.5, D/E of 7. This is a company with almost no debt. They have 1.5M in debt, and over 9M in cash.
* **Management are taking paycuts to maintain cash -** CEO, CFO, and other board members are taking paycuts up to 40% to help preserve cash.
* **Jumping on the COVID help train -** CTX plans to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in May (oh hey, it's May now, look at that)
* **It's a penny stock that's actually low risk!? -** Yes! Penny stocks are notorious for having a high potential reward at a very high risk. It's easier for a stock to go from $0.10 to $0.20 than it is to go from $1000 to $2000. But it's much much much more likely that it goes to $0. Crescita Therapeutics  is a relatively new company, founded in 2016, that's already shown it knows how to function in the best and worst of times. They will not suffer long-term from the pandemic, as many penny stock companies and other micro-cap companies will.
* **It's an alternative industry in the sector at the moment -** Maybe you're getting tired of all the pot companies and COVID test stocks. Why not go with some beauty? When things start to return to some level of normalcy in the coming months/year, and COVID isn't the only thing in the news, stocks may drop. When people are working again, they may smoke less pot (but probably not, honestly). One thing is for sure though, people who buy beauty products, will still want to be beautiful, especially now that's they're going to see people again."

jus_in_bello	1588342674	"I do not currently hold any in UAVS, and I got out with a 30% profit. If you saw me posting on the discord chat (I'm Grubsmack) and saw my last two posts here about UAVS, then you know that I was skeptical about the whole thing from the beginning based on my own DD. 

However, I think we were all wrong, and right, about UAVS. 

Disclaimer: Everything below is speculative, and based on my own research and DD. I'm not suggesting buying or selling the stock. However, if you're currently holding at a loss, it may not be a bad stock to hold onto if you can afford to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, AgEagle and Amazon DO have a partnership of some kind related to drones, and I believe that Amazon was the e-commerce partner mentioned in the last true PR from AgEagle. However, this doesn't mean UAVS is worth anymore than the about $1.3 it's currently trading at, and after yesterday, the stock may be worth less. 

The video yesterday wasn't fake, and it wasn't intentionally leaked. Megan Chilcott is AgEagle's founder's daughter. One of her hobbies/jobs is a videographer, and her job description for AgEagle prior to her gutting her linkedin was making instructional videos for AgEagle's customers. She uploaded the video to her personal website and to her personal Youtube, where she puts the rest of her other videos for other business (as kind of a digital portfolio). Prior to yesterday, neither her website nor her Youtube were highly trafficked by, well, anyone. So I don't think she realized that uploading it would be a big deal, and she has since tried to completely erase her digital footprint for, IMO, potential legal reasons.

However, Amazon and AgEagle had an NDA about the partnership. The existence of an NDA has already been confirmed by AgEagle, which is why they couldn't mention who the e-commerce entity was who had the purchase orders. This tells me two things 1) this is meant to be a limited partnership and 2) the partnership is probably because of proprietary software. I won't bore you with why I think this, plus it really doesn't matter in terms of UAVS worth. 

So, what now? Well, the fact the video was made public is almost certainly a violation of the NDA. This could mean AgEagle owes contractual damages or that Amazon can pull the plug on the partnership. That all depends on the contract itself. However, Amazon may also choose to do nothing, as this whole fiasco really didn't stray outside small stock investor circles. 

My thought is that UAVS is now trading at about what it should be, if not a little higher. If they do get into legal trouble because of yesterday, whether in the form of an SEC investigation or because of potential NDA violations, then the stock is obviously going to drop and the company could be in trouble. There is potential, however. If Amazon was the initial company behind the purchase order last year, they obviously liked something to have ordered more this year. Meaning, the partnership may just be getting started. 

Just my thoughts."	UAVS after yesterday, now what?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbiwk5/uavs_after_yesterday_now_what/

Truth is no one can tell you, but here are some pointers from the past 24hrs.

MVIS is tied to MSFT, just look at their product it‚Äôs literally the same thing. https://youtu.be/uIHPPtPBgHk

The volume on this guy has 190 million more than S&amp;P!!! That‚Äôs 3x the amount in just one day!!

There was for a fact a whale that manipulated the price, this cause triggers to offset, with a panic sell for ppl trying to short this thing.

Patent was approved today, even if you think it‚Äôs false, read it carful and you‚Äôll see MVIS referenced. Again Holo lens comparison.

Many MVIS employees are NOW MSFT employees, one in particular is a senior researcher (hint hint)

They are in the process to updating the holo lens to holo lens 2.

MSFT can continue to pay royalties, buy them out after they‚Äôve paid their debt off, or honestly this company continues to grow because holo lens is the future.

I don‚Äôt believe this is a pump and dump, I believe this is to good to be true. If you want to sell to make a quick buck fine, but my own opinion, do your own DD, this guy is a win-win-win. Yes, there will be a bumpy road to the upside, but after the news either announced on the 7th after hours at 5pm, or 19th, I think based on the CEOs letter for exploring potential acquisition or merger on 5/1. We have good evidence to believe this is the real deal.

‚ÄùEx Microsoft (MSFT) Employees now work at MicroVision (MVIS) 
After some research by the community, a staggering amount of ex Microvision employees have been scooped up by Microsoft over the years. This growing list leads to suggest that Microsoft is very interested in MicroVisions technology and capabilities.

Jack Clevenger ‚Äì Sr. Program Manager (12 years at MVIS as Sr. Program Manager) 

Moh Eslamy ‚Äì Process development working for both Microsoft and MicroVision (6 years at MVIS managing high volume manufacturing/assembly processing for laser projector) 

Karlton Powell ‚Äì Senior Researcher (8 years at MVIS as Senior Research Engineer) 

Given both companies are headquartered in Redmond, WA, a Microsoft acquisition of MicroVision could be an extremely easy transition for both the company and employees. 

Microsoft (MSFT) currently using MicroVision (MVIS) Technology in HoloLens 
On March 31, 2020, Microvision agreed to an agreement for its April 2017 customer to take over production of the components MicroVision had been producing for the customer. Beginning in March MicroVision started earning a royalty on each component shipped that was approximately equal to the gross profit it earned on each component it had previously produced. 

Around the same exact time, Microsoft started expanding production capabilities for its Hololens in order to meet higher demands for the product. 

And to follow that up, the Army which is currently planing to equip its first units with the Integrated Visual Augmentation System toward the end of next year, thanked Microsoft for the expanded commitment to meet production demands. 

‚ÄúOur Microsoft partners have been outstanding in reforming the supply chain where necessary and continuing on with the development in their production and manufacturing facility in California‚Äù 

And if the dots aren‚Äôt connecting enough, immediately after this on April 6th, MicroVision stated their first clue of possibly entering a buyout of some sort. ‚ÄúAs we reported on March 11, we are actively engaged with multiple interested parties to evaluate various opportunities to license our IP as well as other strategic alternatives.‚Äù 

While no one knows for sure if MicroVision‚Äôs technology is in the Hololens, there have been some confirming reports stating that may be the case (found under Hybrid Arrive section). 

Microsoft (MSFT)‚Äôs Possible Expanded Use of MicroVision (MVIS) Technology 
The connection between MicroVision and Microsoft is almost undeniable when it comes to the Hololens reports and timelines. But an additional use of their tech may change everything. 



There are rumors and evidence that Microsoft is using MicroVision technology in their new expanded capability with the Xbox. Microsoft expanding their use of MicroVision technology can show us their interest and commitment to the technology, and also validate why they might think about buying MicroVision out. 

It‚Äôs interesting to note that Microsoft announced an Xbox Series X gameplay reveal event for Thursday, May 7, the same day as MicroVisions conference call. Whether anything of substance is announced is yet to be seen‚Äù

They had a meeting on Apr 22, the day after there was a volume of 2 million. Today there was a recent buy of 250k. So I think companies want to invest and are just waiting for a good time. Which means these buys are willing to lose money but know it will go up soon.

Looking through the presentation they gave I found some interesting things. I‚Äôm honestly a little surprised it‚Äôs not higher. For starters they are the leading company in their industry by market share(literally worth 13% of the entire industry). It‚Äôs also in UK and it‚Äôs 34% of the UK industry. But it‚Äôs mostly in US. They have consistently been gaining money compared to every other quarter.

For their debt they own their fleet so that doesn‚Äôt count. And they will only need to repurchase a fleet in 10sih years. Over the past year they have 5x their earnings. Looking at other money charts they have all improved compared to every other quarter.

They have made an offering of $10.20 for 2.5 million shares. There has also been a recent increase in buys. My thoughts say they are companies buying slowly just waiting for a good time. There has also been some recent insider buys which is usually a good sign.

Looking at the chart before all the corona business they were on an upward trend and above 5$ before hand. It looks like it‚Äôs back on that upward trend. And looking at sector trends the industrial sectors have been doing well. Like HIL and GV.

Personally I feel like Construction companies in general will begin to do well because there are a lot of cities that are hiring construction companies. Also a lot of people understand right now is the best time to do construction while people are stuck at home and it can get done faster. Allowing more jobs to get done which means more revenue."

Oil +20% Again
 
Rally Fades by Half
 
 
Today‚Äôs market got off to a strong start yet again but at the end of the day we had two down waves starting around 2:45 that cut gains by about 2/3.  Market internals were a bit on the soft side with NYSE A/D only 4:3 and NASDAQ 17:15.  Volume was lighter than the past few days and the DJIA had 21 up and 9 down.  The biggest losers were BA -41 and MCD -18 DPs while the gainers were UNH +37, AAPL +30 and HD +26 DPs.  All these names were higher before the last hour with AAPL trading $301 but finishing $297.80.  The news of the day on the economy was not great.  ISM Non-manufacturing Index for Aprildropped to 41.8from 52.5 in March.  50% is the breakpoint for expansion/contraction.  The trade balance showed a widening in the deficit to $44.4 billion from $39.8 in February.  Exports were down $20 billion.  Tomorrow we have the ADP Employment change report for April and weekly MBA Mortgage applications.

SECTORS: Earnings played a part in today‚Äôs market.  NEM was a strong report and the stock, already up from $58 on Friday finished the day $64.91 +2.17 (3.46%), DIS was the big loser with volumes down due to closed parks and no production taking place at the studios.  Streaming is strong, but a big piece is being done at reduced rates or even for free.  At the close the stock was $101.06 -2.12 but after a small rally, the conference call started and after the company disclosed it is suspending its dividend for the first half it slid to 99.25.  BYND reported good sales growth and the recent closures of several major meat processing plants has been buoying prices.  The stock has rallied off an April low of $57 and closed today $100.16 +5.00 and is currently trading $105 + $5 more.
 
Two companies in the same business, EA and ATVI went in opposite directions.  EA was a miss and after closing $119.61 +2.78 it fell t0 112.12 and is currently 113.98 ‚Äì 5.62.  Activision (ATVI) beat handily and it had closed 68.53 +1.83 and is now $72.40 + 3.87 more.  Pinterest (PINS) had risen from a low of $10.10 last month to close $20.81 -.62 but missed on several metrics and has traded down to $16.70 and is $17.15 ‚Äì 3.66.  Also, on the bad news side, UAL finished $24.12 -1.14 (4.5%) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH) warned about it continuing as a ‚Äúgoing concern.‚Äù  The stock is down from $60 and finished the day $11.18 -3.26 (22.58%).

OIL, $24.56 +4.17. Oil was higher overnight and the rally continued on all day.  The stocks were mixed with only the big names moving higher.  XLE closed $37.52 +.43 (1.16%).
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,710.60 -2.70. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We were stopped out of our position in the 5/15 165 calls and I replaced them with the $163 strike.  We are also long NEM.
 
BITCOIN: closed $8985 +50. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today‚Äôs action was a continuing move higher with a high of 9560.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $10.02 + .05 today.
 
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Earlier today during trading hours MVIS went on a fire sale where a whale dumped 700,000 shares of MVIS onto the market. This resulted in a domino effect that triggered many people‚Äôs stop loss orders which brought share prices all the way down to 1.09 per share. This tactic to dump shares...

luvmyruger308	1588722809	I see a lot of people on here saying (dang out of day trades got to ride this one out) are y‚Äôall using your day trades in a valuable way or oh shit I‚Äôm up or down 30$ day trade time. Seems like with stocks we are playing with day trades are essential to hold on to. Just like today I sold MVIS in the 1.60$ and bought back in at 1.06$ when it dropped why waste day trades on 4$ or am I seeing this all wrong?

sra-uomi	1588722614	"I've lost thousands on penny stocks before, specifically around this time last year. I took a long hiatus from even touching anything until I educated myself with the basics and while I did so I sat on the sidelines and watched others. 

There is one common theme, it's constant with Penny Stocks. 

Buy the Hype, and SELL at a profit if possible. 

I sold at 1.00 for 200 MVIS today when I originally bought in at .41 and made $118. 

I could have held until it was in the 1.50+ range but I didn't. I was comfortable with what my return was and blew MVIS off for most of the day and found RTTR and watched TTI. 

Some of you played SCON &amp; NAK which I missed out but you know what,

There's always going to be an MVIS or SCON or NAK.

 There is always going to be a P&amp;D to take advantage of. 

I have RTTR &amp; TTI and I don't care about what they do long term, all I care about is my return on that investment in the short-term because Penny Stocks offer NO security for long term gains. 

Next week or tomorrow or next month there will be another RTTR, TTI and MVIS. 

I've made $300+ Thursday , $150&lt; Friday, $150&gt; Monday and $100&gt; today. 

No losses, just a strict return. Just profit, I see green and a number I'm comfortable with and I bow out. 

I will absolutely tell you all I am not professional, nowhere God damn nowhere near a professional but I'm trying to educate myself along the way and have taken up paper trading. 

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing besides following trends and accepting a win when I've been given a win. 

I just do this shit for fun and I play the game. 

I'm not WSB fucking with options because that's how you lose your ass and if you don't know what you're doing and especially with Penny Stocks, you will lose. 

I am not trying to be rude or anything I just know there are a lot of new people and they're excited with the gains they've made and they should be excited. Just don't fall for the BS with every other person saying ""THIS IS IT üöÄüöÄüöÄ BUY ""XYZ"" NOW"". 

I'm getting more into doing my own research and sure DD from others CAN mean a BIG WIN for you but MOST of the time, that will not be the case, don't trust me. Trust the experienced investors that I'm sure will back me up when I say there's no better DD than the DD you do yourself. 

Make your own decisions and if something runs and is running, decide if it makes sense for you to jump into something that's already seen an increase, and accept the possibility that you may lose but don't chase if it's mid-day/power hour. If it's already peaked and you think it might again...highly unlikely. I've seen one user post about buying in @ UAV for 4+ and excuse me what I bought in at 1.21 and was leaning on bowing out at $3.50 but set a stop loss and a limit sell for 4.00 and got lucky. Even if it peaked at 2.00 I would have grabbed my profit and ran but that run was INSANE. 

MVIS is running until Thursday and I bought back in @1.06, with profits I made since yesterday ($150 or so) and already I see major return which I definitely intend to cash in on as soon as market opens. 


I'm just ranting at this point but I hope this helps some of you see the reality of Penny Stocks. I know some of you remember PRPO (Precipio). We all saw what happened there, and a lot of you saw what happened with UAVS and DECN and I guarantee, the same thing will happen with MVIS. 



I just care about you guys, this is a great community and we are all here to win, right? If that's the case then we need to be realistic with what we are promoting and know when to take a win and move on. 

I really won't be upset if I get shit on or told off because I know how abrasive people can be.


Someone said earlier ""if you show off your big dick long enough you'll get two in the ass"".

I laughed my ass off because it's the truth. 

My last word of ranting/rambling/advice. 

Set a fucking Stop Loss, guys.

I've been lurking this sub since I made this account, as well as WallStreetBets and Options, and only recently (Feb-ish) started contributing.

I've seen the userbase of this and WSB skyrocket recently with this pandemic market SNAFU.

I'm worried WSB attitudes are going to start flowing over into this subreddit. 

I enjoy the arrogance and comedy and camaraderie associated with the losses and gains there, but it belongs... There.

I've already seen comments that are akin to the general tone of wsb (such as slang used almost exclusively there, endearing or not).

Others have seen the general ""I can't read,"" ""no idea what I'm looking at,"" meanwhile absolutely burying the technical analysis that was the point of the post.

There has also been an immense increase in spam; duplicated posts, posts with half a sentence all in caps TRUST ME, BUY THIS OMG with no analysis or DD.

While I do enjoy that, and even participate in it, this sub isn't the right one for that. WSB is great for what it is, but it doesn't belong here."	This isn't WSB, please stop acting like it is.

Noexit007	1588704021	"A 700k share sale was made by a single seller. This was likely an INTENTIONAL scare tactic to shock smaller buyers. It caused many stop losses to trigger which snowballed things.

Why would a seller do such a thing?

Simple.

1. The Whale sells 700k shares
2. Stop losses are triggered making things worse
3. Other buyers panic and sell (possibly even for losses)
4. When the time is right and it's low enough, the whale buys back in chunks so the price doesn't sky again.

5. Profit for the whale.

Basically some person with 700k shares just punked a lot of investors into selling in one way or another so they could buy back cheaper.  There was no news. There was no reason for this drop.  Just investors trying to get the stock cheaper in later hours or after hours trading.

I didn't know this was possible, but now it's not looking like it's going to go near that price point.

&gt;In an effort to address the necessity to reduce the spread of COVID-19 the Company is enhancing its line of wellness products with the addition of triple layer, quality face masks.

Take_Notice_Walk	1588699447	"I keep seeing these comparisons brought up, and I don't get it other than both being pumped and rumors of potentially bought out.

But they have some key differences which changes how we should view them, imo:

1. MVIS is actually a legit company.
2. MVIS has 10 times the market cap.
3. MVIS actually has some innovative technology. I remembered reading up on them 6 months ago and thought about buying in. The consensus was that they have some technology for the future. I can't find the source, and I'm not going to bother finding it. But just saying MVIS isn't some bs company with nothing to offer.
   1. I believe I was looking for some augmentative reality and 3D sensing stocks at the time. I basically passed on MVIS because it was a penny stock, and I was told that you should never invest in penny stocks. So if this stock caught my eye 6 months ago, I wouldn't be surprised if they are being eyed for a buyout by another company. It probably won't be Micorosft. That's too good to be true. But who knows who. Point is, that they are appealing.
4. If you go on Google Maps, you will see that MVIS actually has a real office building and isn't some Aerotyne wannabe."	I don't get the comparisons between UAVS and MVIS?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ge20cu/i_dont_get_the_comparisons_between_uavs_and_mvis/

coronablocked	1588696514	"I think GNBT could be a small-scale version of PSTI based off the current situation alone

GNBT:

Small biotech company developing and manufacturing samples of possible CV vaccine (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/generex-biotechnology-initiates-peptide-manufacturing-123010024.html); probably starting clinical trials in the near future if funding is gained. they're using a patented system activation mechanism that is already patented to them to make the vaccine (see https://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-26831283/documents/5e73891471930g8BqVxh/Ii-Key-nCOV%20Peptide%20Vaccine.Overview.3%2019%2020.pdf if you want to see more about it).

Financials don't look too bad for a company of its stature: moderate debt doesn't pose a lot of risks to future goals as of right now.

Main thing to focus on with this company is its potential in the vaccine market. it poses a lot of possible profit and large growth if it is able to get funding and go through CV trials. In the past week it's also shown positive results for vaccines aiming to reduce the recurrence of breast cancer (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/generex-subsidiary-nugenerex-immuno-oncology-132432839.html). HUGE chance of GNBT securing funding to continue these projects.

Largest takeaways from CV vaccine article:

""-Submitted proposal to BARDA for start-to-finish funding to develop an approved, commercial Ii-Key peptide vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus""


""[CEO] Moscato continued, ‚ÄúIn addition to our efforts to develop Ii-Key peptide vaccines for oncology, the Generex management team is actively involved in a COVID-19 emergency response effort. We are advancing discussions with BARDA and have been working hard to assemble an impressive group of partner organizations to implement an accelerated, multifaceted development program to commercialize our Ii-Key-SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine in response to the U.S. government calls for a vaccine solution to the coronavirus crisis. We are working to secure manufacturing, laboratory, clinical, regulatory, and expert medical advisory services with world-class organizations like PPD, Polypeptide Labs, Bachem, Ajinomoto, Thermo-Fisher, CTL Laboratories, and San Diego Center for AIDS Research as well as renowned clinical research sites at Tufts University Medical Center and Wake Forest Baptist Health. Together we have prepared a full proposal for the end-to-end development of an Ii-Key-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Additionally, we continue discussions with Canadian health authorities, having held a pre-CTA teleconference last week, and we plan to finalize our regulatory strategy in collaboration with Health Canada in the coming weeks."""

Wanted to come in and share some research and DD I‚Äôve been doing for IZEA. With earnings coming up on 5/14 and a few major announcements recently, IZEA is ripe for a big run up to and beyond earnings call, more on this shortly.

For those unaware, IZEA is a large marketing firm based in FL. Working with brands and entertainers to connect and run ad campaigns.

IZEA announced recently the acquisition of Twitch as an approved platform to add to their marketing software, allowing brands a wider audience to push their goods/services to. Opening themselves up for a larger share of client budgets for both existing and potential clients. Big win.

They also announced yesterday the major success and milestone of their BrandGraph system has surpassed 500 million pieces of content analyzed and indexed to better their position with marketers. With the announcement, and to presumably flex their muscle a bit, they‚Äôve announced an event on 5/18 for brands to gain a ton of more info and leverage the ongoing pandemic in their marketing campaigns. Another really big win.

IZEA already had a good run up yesterday 5/4 and it‚Äôs pulled back a bit today, though earnings are expecting to be smashed on 5/14 with news of exactly how well BrandGraph has been performing. And with the event scheduled so soon after earnings share price is expected to run up. 

I‚Äôve seen speculation of it topping over $1.25 with the good news, though can‚Äôt find a reliable analyst source confirming this. I‚Äôm going in today, depending on if funds clear into the account today will determine how large of a position I take.

Pre-Covid pricing was about $1.15. 52 week high was +$3.00, which dropped due to ingredient sourcing issues.Earnings call is May 11th.My take is that people like drinking ginger ale when they are feeling ill as a holistic remedy, and we are in the midst of a pandemic.

If the supply chain issues are resolved this could return to $3.00.

Username_Checks-Out-	1588842635	"Los Angeles, CA, May 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- HQ Global Education, Inc. (OTC: HQGE) announced today that that its wholly owned subsidiary Big M Entertainment Pictures(BMEP) is ready to begin production on its full-length feature film,\*CAPTURED,\*in early June, and that they are confident that they will be able to complete the projectwhile adhering to all necessary guidance and requirements pertaining to the current COVID pandemic.

Marvin Williams, President of BMEP and one the films producers, commented, As they say in Hollywood,*The show must go on*, and BMEP is dedicated to stepping up to the challenge of delivering an edge of your seat hair raising supernatural horror film with minimum crew levels and maximum production value.

Mr. Williams added, What makes this moment unique from a filmmaking perspective is a uniquely crafted production workflow where we have minimized the number of crew members needed to execute the filming while still delivering a unique visual experience for a demanding audience. We also remain committed an aggressive post-production schedule including delivery of the completed film in Q4 of 2020.

*CAPTURED*is an independent supernatural horror film and psychological thriller that takes place on the heels of a crippling pandemic. The film is centered on a couple who set out on a vacation getaway and just as they arrive at their destination they learn that the safer at home order has been reinstated and the quarantine will be back in effect within 24 hours. The disgruntled couple reluctantly decide to return home, but before doing so they stop to pick up a keepsake which later unleashes a horrific force inside their home, leaving them trapped inside while also facing the anxiety of the ongoing pandemic.

The films creators have built upon elements of earlier successful releases, includingthe minimal casting arrangements seen in films like Paranormal Activity, which grossed over $193M at the U.S. box office, and the gritty, realistic styling of The Blair Witch Project, which grossed over $248M at the U.S. box office.

The irony of the horror film genre is its remarkable ability to consistently rank among the most profitablegenres without relying on high priced A-List actors, which it does by introducing a steady stream of outstanding up and coming young talent.*CAPTURED*continues this tradition by featuringrising newcomer Jamie Ohlsen, who has appeared in seven features in preparation for what by all appearances figures to be his first breakout role. As an added bonus, and perhaps a box office kicker, the film has also been written to include a surprise star cameo role, the details of which are in final negotiations and currently being kept secret.

The film concept developed by BMEP and demonstrated in*CAPTURED*provides one of the cornerstones of the companys signature offerings and has already been received enthusiastically by the same distribution companies that are now in negotiations with BMEP regardingtwo of BMEPs documentaries,*TREES*and\*DISTANCE,\*both of which are currently in pre-production. Additional information on those films will be forthcoming soon.

Main questions: 

What's your entry? 0.60

What's your price target? 1.69

What's a safe exit in case it fails? 0.59

When should I sell it? Normally I don't give advice to something like this but pay attention to the volume/price strength, if it maintains momentum hold it towards the price target, if it's showing weakness or slowing down, then sell it. I can't give advice like these because it can either help or hurt you creating a form of FOMO. Trust your common sense or gut if it looks iffy."

TheBazaarTrades	1588835010	"Tonight's a tough one. Too many inconsistencies and plenty of unattractive parabolics I didn't like; Despite looking head to toe around the market, I had to stretch the window price scan wider than normal that I'm used to. Overall, something did come up. A very unique sure thing bullish chart of NLS. While my posts are uniquely focused on searching **before the move,** something occurred to me reviewing each ticker that's throwing me off... Dead slow-moving stocks that suddenly explode based on catalyst news much like GNUS, MGNX, &amp; XRF. These are impossible to catch **before the move**, and more or less wasn't picked up from an overnight activity yesterday (maybe subtle, I don't know). I probably will be doing some tweaking &amp; testing to sharpen my searches and overviews.

Anyways... TLDR let's get down to business. 

NLS appears to be having some overnight pullback activity today. More activity was pushed for a swing opportunity noticed under the bid order history. Something a little baffling to me though is one or two things might be played out here: 

Either a perfect entry-level at $5.00 or a better patient entry-level at $4.1 (if supposedly it pulls back more). Look at all three charts... what do they all have in common? They seem to be following the same pattern of stair climbing at the 50EMA (the peach-colored line).

In short, this is a strong bullish momentum chart if you look at all three of the daily charts. You can either test the entry at overall: $4.2, $4.1, &amp; if you're brave it's current lv $5.15 (which I don't recommend).

Their shares outstanding are only 3.8 mil ish, so 25 mil in a direct offering shares seems to be a one time, large offering IMO in the short term.  Gives them plenty of capital to get through to the coming revenue stream.  Not considering the 2 drugs still in trials, their one drug will provide (estimated) solid revenue in the short-medium term.

AngelaTheRipper	1588816191	"To open I will make a bold claim, the rumors are true. Why do I think so, because that‚Äôs a pre-requirement for what follows to make sense. You can call me insane, idgaf. 

Someone knows the above and has orchestrated a massive scheme to profit on this fact. We‚Äôll call them whales. 

Whales started the buyout rumor in order to get the volume up. Nobody knows where this rumor started, MSFT using MVIS technology in their shit has been public knowledge for years. Probably pumped the stock a bit themselves, FOMO in full effect, then pumped it some more in extended hours using the fact that the volume is low, most stocks don‚Äôt move much in extended hours mind you. If you look at the past few days majority of gains happened during extended hours. Let it run for a few days to further build up the volume. Pump again during extended hours, keep that FOMO going. This was Friday and Monday.

Then came yesterday (Tuesday), normal start although the momentum started to fizzle down. Then came the stop raid. Why, a few reasons, get some cheap stocks, shake off a chunk of the weaker hands, get an estimate of how much you can really crash it, trigger an SSR breaker, and lower the confidence into the stock which in turn lowers the volume. Then just let it recover or pump it up a bit, you need less volume but you still need a lot of volume to pull this shit off.

This brings us into today (Wednesday), not much growth since yesterday, the momentum fizzled out but those who were holding were holding hoping to sell during late Wednesday or early Thursday or push their luck and sell before the call, few planned to actually brave the earnings report and conference call. None of us believed the rumor to be true. 

Then came the massive dip, courtesy of a fake news headline, bots/trolls spreading it around, and probably some good old fashioned market manipulation. 

This brings us to accumulation. The chart behaved weird, frequently just trading in a 2 cent range for hours, like there were points where it broke out in either direction but it basically stayed in 1.08 to 1.10 range for a large chunk of the trading session. This brings us to the SSR breaker, once that‚Äôs tripped for the rest of the trading day and the next day you can only place a short sale order at a higher price than the current price. So shorts had to play ball and sell for 1.10 or 1.09 when the price was at 1.08. A dip like that attracted a lot of shorts looking for a quick buck. The whales have eaten up all the short sales coming in and the weak hands getting out and are holding millions of shares. There was no recovery in the after hours today. Why, cause they don‚Äôt need it. The minor spike in AH was probably some dumber shorts getting burned and having to cover.

Tomorrow (Thursday) the trading day is going to be a sideways slide with close to 0 net change, it‚Äôs gonna look like the tail end of a one day runner after its done spiking, whoever was going to panic sell panic sold already. SSR breaker got tripped and volume is going to be in the gutter (buyers have no confidence in this bullshit anymore, shorts can‚Äôt bring it down, whales have fed).

After hours the rumors will be confirmed to true. Yes Microsoft or at least someone is buying, might be Facebook, might be Amazon, might be Tesla, might be someone else. Price will absolutely explode between the moment that‚Äôs said and 8 PM. 

Friday, FOMO is again in full effect, everyone is chasing the stock, whales will either unload or just hold until buyout comes. Past Friday, who fucking cares, this is penny land after all."

Slow_is_Fast	1588812587	"So I‚Äôve seen this pop up several times lately and I‚Äôd like to give some answers from personal experience. 

So what is a pattern day trader (PDT)?
Anyone who makes 3+ trades in any ‚Äúrolling‚Äù five market days. 
Example: On a Monday, I buy 100 shares of ABC stock in premarket, and during market hours, I buy another 100 shares. After the bell, on the same day, in post market trading, I sell all shares. 
This is where some people get caught, since it‚Äôs TWO lots, and you sell both at end of the day, that is TWO day trades. 
Now the next day, Tuesday, I buy shares in DEF stock. And, I sell them this same day. 
That‚Äôs day trade number THREE. 
Since I committed two day trades on Monday, those will be gone the following Monday. Then on the next day, Tuesday, the third falls off. 
Here‚Äôs a caveat, let‚Äôs say one of the days in this 5 day market stretch is a federal holiday. Then instead of the day trades falling off on Monday and then Tuesday, it would then be Tuesday and Wednesday. 

What happens if within these 5 days you make a fourth day trade?
You are flagged as a PDT. 
If you‚Äôre account does not have $25k total balance (cash, securities, equity), your account will incur an ‚Äúequity call‚Äù where you‚Äôll need to fund your account to the aforementioned $25k total balance. 

What happens if you don‚Äôt fund your account? 
Your account will be restricted to cash only. Which means that your transactions will need to settle before you have cash to buy other shares. 
This restriction is lifted if, and when, your balance is over $25k. 

The account requirement of $25k must be maintained at all times or an equity call is triggered. 

Here are fun facts.. I learned all this the hard way. I got flagged as a PDT. Obviously this is an issue. 
I sent a message to my trading platform, E*TRADE, requesting that I change my account from margin to cash. I didn‚Äôt want this issue and thought that this would remove the flag of ‚Äúpattern day trader‚Äù. 
It wouldn‚Äôt. 
However, my advisor offered a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù in that if I requested to reset the counter, eliminate the PDT flag while staying a margin account, then all would be well and I could trade again without an equity call. And the warnings and flag goes away. 

Caveat: I break the PDT rules again, I‚Äôm stuck with it forever. No exceptions and I have to meet the equity call. 

So, I‚Äôve used my silver bullet, but learned exactly what I can get away with. And what I can‚Äôt. Hopefully whoever reads this learns something from my experience.

Split Market -NAZ Up, DOW Down
 
Earnings Galore
 
 
Today‚Äôs market was a split affair from right after the open.  While the NASDAQ was higher, the DJIA and S&amp;P 500 were sloppy at best.  While the NASDAQ has regained its entire loss for 2020 (not the highs, but since 1/2/2020), the DJIA is still -5054 or 17.5% and the S&amp;P 500 is -392 or 12%. At the highs today the DJIA was +171 and finished on the lows -218.45 (.91%), NASDAQ +45.27 (.51%), S&amp;P 500 -20.02 (.70%), the Russell -10.50 (.82%) and the DJ Transports -115.47 (1.43%).
Market internals were weak with NYSE 2:1 down and NASDAQ 1.5:1 down.  Volume was also light.  On the DJIA we were decidedly down with 23 lower, 6 higher and PFE unchanged.  The gainers were AAPL +21 and MSFT +12 DPs while on the downside we had UNH -29 and BA &amp; TRV -24 DPs.  Sectors on the upside included Info tech and consumer discretionary while Financial, Utilities and Energy the weak groups.

Coby9	1588805861	"Hey all,  
So I was always told to have a goal in mind that way you have a proper strategy to reach that goal. I'm 27 years old and my goal is to buy a house (600k budget) and pay it of as soon as possible. I work a normal job making a normal salary (35k-55k). I have no education and cannot go back to school so this job is pretty much it for me. Maybe a few raises here and there. Long story short, I came to the conclusion that in order to make money I'd have to have something else on the side. I checked a few options and decided that trading is the way for me since it's not time consuming and I can do it a few minutes a day, set a stop loss and let 'er ride. I've been making decent gains anywhere between 20$ to 70$ a day trading with a 700$ account. My goal is to reach high 5 figures without having to add any capital, just working off the initial 700$. I know I might be living in fantasy land but I see a lot of people posting hundreds of dollars of gains with a small capital. Now I know it can all be social media flexing but worst case scenario I'm willing to lose the 700$ since the reward is worth the risk.

Kids shows are insanely lucrative and given the amount of households that have upped their streaming subscriptions due to COVID, there will be an even higher viewing audience come June 15th when it launches. People seemed to have missed the DD as it was released midday and is now catching on in AH up 80+%

This will continue to rise tomorrow and through the month as a potential hold if wanted. This is based on actual releases with big companies that have contracts in place, not purely speculation and fake email screenshots.

bweb82	1588798309	"OK.  So I am not sure if this is how it's always been and I am just now noticing it, but there is a HUGE delay between these three platforms when it comes to displaying prices.  I use a combination of three platforms - TDA for level II and charting, Webull for orders, tradingview for advanced charting ideas and screening.

&amp;#x200B;

TDA on level II seems to be the most accurate.  Tradingview seems to be second.  And Webull, I am not sure if this is how its always been and I am just now noticing, but they seem to be WAY behind these other two.

Since joining this subreddit five trading days ago, my overall penny stock trading account is +35.34%. I was at around 50% but have overtraded today and yesterday. It happens. 

If you're interested, here is my twitch channel. There is also content there from previous videos. My TTI prediction of $0.70 fell about four cents short, but my MVIS prediction did really well. Please don't expect 100% accuracy on these predictions. My average is about 55-60% accuracy, but the higher reward than risk ratio keeps me profitable over the long term.

mdh1119	1588795427	"Never been this on the fence before.

CytoDyn's CEO has caused a stir by selling several million shares to the market. The CEO's explanation for this was that exercising his warrants and options in order to buy shares from the company was to provide cash for the company through buying existing shares rather than introduce new shares to the market and dilute the stock further, which they have done in the past.

However, the resale of the shares he purchased from CytoDyn through exercising his warrants/options is what drew suspicion. If he was so sure that leronlimab was going to be successful, why wouldn't he wait?

Meanwhile, however, they have contracted Ajinomoto's chemical and drug synthesis services to produce very large quantities in leronlimab, a relationship which Ajinomoto itself announced, and not CytoDyn.

It appears that CytoDyn themselves are aware they are against great odds and aren't sure if things are going to work out, but are pushing forward anyway.

CryptoMeThis	1588793693	"May 6, 2020 08:03 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News

NASDAQ/TASE: KTOV), a clinical-stage company advancing first-in-class therapies to overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with several institutional and accredited investors for the purchase and sale of 25,000,002 of the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares represented by American Depositary Shares (ADSs), at a purchase price of $0.40 per ADS, in a registered direct offering, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10 million. **Kitov has also agreed to issue to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 25,000,002 ADSs.**¬†Each ADS represents one ordinary share, no par value, of Kitov.¬†The offering is expected to close on or about May 8, 2020, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.

**The warrants will have an exercise price of $0.40 per ADS and will be exercisable at any time upon issuance and will expire five and one-half years from the date of issuance.**

Kitov intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund the development of its oncology drug candidates, acquisition of new assets and for general working capital purposes.

Can someone explains this? Does this offering/warrant means that private investors invested $10mil right now and they also have the option to buy more within the five and one-half years at $0.40/share to max of 25,000,002 shares?"	$KTOV Kitov Pharma offering, Why did people panic sell?	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/geqts4/ktov_kitov_pharma_offering_why_did_people_panic/

BarginBin	1588791238	"Hello everyone and welcome back! 

People seemed to like my post yesterday so why not make it a recurring thing? We could all use some structure right now.

The big tickers flooding the sub today were remnants of **$MVIS** (r.i.p.), the new hotness of **$IZEA**, and **$GNUS** coming in later in the day. Hopefully, these stocks will continue to rise in after hours for those who joined up after they had already begun their journey upwards

**DDs YOU SHOULD READ**

However, I thought I could first list some solid DDs that may have been overlooked today.
[**$ZN by u/TheBazaarTrades:**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gefas5/zn_divine_insanitya_godly_outlook/) The bloodhound of our humble sub did it once again. Since this post, $ZN rose over 16% to close out the day. Required reading right here and pray that prices will float upwards more.
[**$BBCP by u/DragonElder:**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gebmag/bbcp_a_way_more_in_depth_dd_honestly_think_its/) First post I seen from this user, but a lot of promise here in his skills and his point about construction sticks. I live near the tristate and i-95 is popping off right now. The important part is that $BBCP rose over 4% today and the chart suggests a new upward trend.

**WHAT I WAS WRONG/RIGHT ABOUT YESTERDAY**

I personally took a large hit on $KTOV and $VAL today. Not sure if those could bounce back in after hours, but I‚Äôm planning on holding cause I‚Äôm a stubborn ass. I got scared and left $SHIP as well. Didn‚Äôt want to become so jaded just yet.
However, I was lucky on $RTW which jumped today more than 15%. I guess everybody gets one. $BIOC also keeps growing so once more‚Ä¶ thank you u/cicero1982 who recieves a lot of shoutouts on stocktwits like a folkhero.

**THE NEW CLASS**

**$SINT** - This guy jumped up almost 6% today after making steady gains for the past five days. Might be a long-term hold but (define ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù as more than overnight) could be pumped if continues to grow in volume or large change in after-hours trading. 

**$UMRX** - My personal baby so take this enthusiasm with the largest grain of salt. Heading towards preclinical trials for newly developed cancer tumor treatment and beat their last earnings quarter by 120%. [Here‚Äôs my first ever DD for some links]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gelspn/umrx_from_the_ground_up_dd_in_comments/)

**$CNAT** - Picked this up from stocktwits. Has a merger vote tomorrow, but debate over whether that‚Äôll raise it up to $1-ish. At least, [that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs being valued at for the merger]( https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/28/1976385/0/en/Conatus-Pharmaceuticals-and-Histogen-Enter-into-Definitive-Merger-Agreement.html)

**$SXTC:** Traditional Chinese medicine [rated as a buy a few days ago.]( https://zolmax.com/investing/china-sxt-pharmaceuticals-nasdaqsxtc-lifted-to-buy-at-valuengine/4041201.html) This may be the riskiest one I checked out, but it made a nice +7% tease during trading today.

And that‚Äôs it for today. I hope some of this info is useful, or at least entertaining to read. Support your local DD-ers here on r/pennystocks and as always‚Ä¶

IZEA had a pretty big spike overnight and flew up to .74 today, its sliding back down a bit just like it did yesterday, the run should last until 5/14 earnings call.  


Found an early [Q2 news release](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/05/1995930/0/en/IZEA-Completes-TapInfluence-Platform-Integration.html) about the transition from IZEA's TapInfluence program being integrated into their new IZEAx platform for both influencers and marketers/brands. With this the recapture of a Major Fortune 500 client as well as other smaller clients being reintegrated and spending with IZEA. Earnings should be stellar in my opinion. This, coupled with the new BrandGraph System and the new access to Twitch for marketers and influencers, should result in major gains this quarter (as well as Q3 but not getting ahead of ourselves).  


I am in on IZEA for another 850 shares, cost basis now .58

PradoMV96	1588972802	"**What is Biocept &amp; what do they do?**
* Biocept is a company that focuses on developing innovative diagnostic solutions that give doctors &amp; their patients the necessary information all from a non-intrusive biopsy they call [Liquid Biopsy](https://biocept.com/about/)

**What are the benefits of Liquid Biopsy?**
* With their patented technology they call Liquid Biopsy, it allows for Doctors to analyze and interrogate CTCs and ctDNA for certain biomarkers.
* With this, physicians can be better informed about the actionable molecular information associated with a patient‚Äôs cancer.
* Because they use a simple blood sample, this molecular information can be obtained non-invasively and more rapidly than a tissue biopsy, this leading to a quicker/more efficient diagnosis, which allows for the doctor to curate the best treatment plan possible for the cancer patient.

**[Their tech is patent protected](https://biocept.com/patents/)**
* As of January 2018, Biocept‚Äôs liquid biopsy technologies are protected by 22 issued patents in the US, EU, Australia, China, Japan, South Korea, as well as other countries.
* They have a worldwide patent protection on their highly sensitive methods for detecting cancer biomarkers in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and on circulating tumor cells (CTCs).
* They have [39 parents](https://pasteboard.co/J7tcCpl.png) around the world to protect their proprietary technology 

**Why their patent protected tech is One Of A Kind**
* Biocept has [implemented use of cocktails of antibodies](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9834817B2/en) for the capture and enrichment of cells of interest. This differentiates Biocept from similar companies and allows Biocept to capture a broader array of CTCs.
* Their [patented Target-Selector Assays for ctDNA](https://www.genomeweb.com/resources/new-product/biocept-target-selector-kits) use real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing (NGS).
- This patent encompasses Biocept‚Äôs proprietary [‚Äúswitch-blocker‚Äù](https://biocept.com/technology/)technology, which ¬†is designed to improve detection rates for these oncogenes, allows physicians to make informed decisions for the selection of therapy and monitoring of treatment response over time for patients with cancer.

*Here's all the links in regards to all of their parents invade you would like to read much more in depth**
* [Link 1](https://biocept.com/patents/)

* [Link 4](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9128082B2/en)

**Financials: Year end &amp; Q4 of 2019**
* [Fourth quarter revenues reached a record](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biocept-reports-2019-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial-results-301029886.html) **1.8 Million**
* Q4 revenue is up **108%** compared to that of Q4 from 2018.
* Q4 ended **17%** higher than the previous quarter
* They beat their Quarterly expectations by **5%**

**Business Overview**
* They plan to grow revenue this year from Q1-Q4 by  utilizing their primary sales strategy which¬†is to engage medical oncologists and other physicians in the United States at private and group practices, hospitals, laboratories and cancer centers. In addition, we market our clinical trial and research services to pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations.
* They plan to grow their business by by directly offering medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, pulmonologists, pathologists and other physicians our Target-Selector liquid biopsy CTC and ctDNA assays.
* They plan to expand their growth through collaborations with leading university hospitals and research centers. They [Collaborate with key thought leaders, physicians and clinical researchers](https://pasteboard.co/J7tbT46.png)

**Recent News to positively impact $BIOC &amp; stock price**
* On February 10, Biocept [announced a laboratory services agreement](https://ir.biocept.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biocept-enters-laboratory-services-agreement-california-based) with a California based independent physician association. This means that a Large independent physician association servicing California will now offer access to Biocept's Target selector liquid biopsy testing for the management of patients with cancer. 
* On February 14th, biocept [announced the promotion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biocept-appoints-cory-j-dunn-senior-vice-president-of-commercial-operations-301004449.html) of¬†Cory J. Dunn, M.S., M. Ed. to Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations.
 - This is a big deal because she held multiple leadership positions at life sciences companies specializing in diagnostics, including GenomeDx Biosciences, PLUS Diagnostics and Genoptix. 
* On March 9th, Biocept [announced the publication](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newly-published-data-in-journal-of-clinical-pathology-provides-clinical-validation-for-biocepts-target-selector-qpcr-assay-to-identify-cancer-associated-mutations-301019347.html) of clinical data in the peer-reviewed¬†Journal of Clinical Pathology¬†that further validates the Company's Target Selector‚Ñ¢ qPCR Assay using ""Switch Blocker"" technology to identify cancer-related mutations in liquid biopsy samples.
 - Here is more [information &amp; the study done](https://jcp.bmj.com/content/early/2020/03/04/jclinpath-2019-206381) regarding this announcement
* on April 2nd, they [announced]( https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/australia-patent-issued-for-primer-switch-mutation-detection-and-amplification-platform-301033971.html) that they have been granted Australia Patent number: 2017268486, which is intellectual property protection for Biocept's Primer-Switch technology that is useful for ctDNA analysis using real-time PCR and associated analysis methods, including next-generation sequencing.
* On April 9th, they [announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brazil-patent-granted-for-biocepts-target-selector-oncogene-mutation-enrichment-and-detection-platform-301038067.html) that Biocept has been granted Brazil Patent No. BR112013028296-7, which is the  intellectual property protection for the Switch-Blocker technology that is core to Biocept's Target Selector assays for ctDNA analysis using real-time PCR,¬†Sanger¬†sequencing and next-generation sequencing.
* On April 28th, biocept [announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biocept-announces-ce-ivd-mark-and-availability-of-its-target-selector-egfr-molecular-assay-kit-in-europe-301048149.html) the award of CE (Conformit√© Europ√©ene)-IVD Mark for its Target Selector‚Ñ¢ molecular assay EGFR Kit. ¬†The CE Mark confirms that the Company's Target Selector kit products meet the requirements of the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive and allows Biocept to commercialize its kits throughout the European Union and other CE Mark geographies.
 -**This is a HUGE deal** because it opens up new markets and opportunities for biocept. This will definitely be reflected up this year's earnings

**Target Price &amp; Forecasts**
* Finviz currently sets their [target price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIOC) $1.00
*CNN money sets the [target price](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=BIOC) at $1.00
*WSJ sets the [target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BIOC/research-ratings) at $1.00

**Final thoughts &amp; comments**
* I personally have invested in 500 shares in at .38
* Despite the coronavirus affecting multiple industries/sectors, I do not believe they were impacted
* Their technology truly is one of a kind and best part of all is that their technology is patent protected. 
* I do believe it will reach $1.00 by Q1 earnings call &amp; I believe they will definitely be above $1.00 come Q2.
* All their new patents &amp; partnerships with the likes of Thermo Fisher, LabCorp, Quest diagnostics &amp; multiple top quality universities only goes on to show how this company not only has Amazing cancer tech, but this year will definitely be their best year in terms of revenue.

At the end of the day, like I mentioned in all my other DDs, this is just all the information I dug to find with legitimate &amp; cited sources. I do this so you can make the best possible well informed decision before you decide to make a purchase. 

As I've mentioned to most of you, I'm well into the cancer companies/industry because of my father's illness. This ""Liquid Biopsy"" is seriously amazing and as soon as it catches on it will tap into a market that other companies aren't in.

Like I mentioned in this post, with traditional biopsies, it is invasive &amp; depending on the location of the tumor, some patients can't even get a biopsy. Plus with a traditional biopsy, you run the risk of aggravating the cancer &amp; accelerating it's growth. With the liquid biopsy, it changes all that and it allows for the oncologist to plan the best form of treatment since they'll have all the knowledge possible of the cancer prior to making the treatment plan.

Anyways, hope this DD can provide you the best knowledge possible so you can make a well informed decision before deciding to purchase stocks. I have tomorrow and Sunday off of work, so I will be posting more DDs on companies I feel will have positive growth this year.

Animated_post	1588970761	"Its all numbers &amp; emotion and or news.  You guys have taught me a lot about trading in the few weeks I've been lurking.  These are some of my observations(sure some are obvious, but they may not be to new people like myself):

Earnings reports are a good base level assumption on future prices.  Looking at past earnings reports spread out, you may be able to make a good guess to as how the stock will be affected.  Getting in before an earnings repot can be key, if it beats projections we be going up.  

5 day trends are key.  Also looking how a company did before the COVID crisis to understand its possible long term strength.  I feel like weve had a good few months to judge stocks under the current problems of the quarantine to judge how they may continue, but real understanding will probably come after most Q2 earnings.  So I figure tech stocks are obviously a good place to be searching.  So far thats how I've made most my money.

Who am I kidding, the internet is an amazing emotional reaction tool to use.  Scrape and watch twitter,reddit,stockwits, etc to gauge where people may be putting their money.  I've rode a few waves doing this making small gains but gain nonetheless.

News and geopolitics.  I come from researching Geopolitics and it has helped me immensely.  Understand the world economy helps understand things at home and reactions to other world markets, however America is usually a trend setter but I would argue China has a major influence.  Dips come when Trump continues his trade wars.  So watch for that.  China and Americas partnership is essential to how we know growth right now.

 Look to the future and do your own DD.  Look around the corner using news and investor releases to see for possible developments that mesh with whats hot or needed in society.  Its all supply and demand as weve seen with Oil.

However the current COVID CRISIS affects everything.  BIOPHARM has been up and down due to hopes of a vaccine, and the possible gains under our form of capitalism.  If a company makes a vaccine, will they make money off of it or will they partner with the government in order to streamline and give the public an affordable-price-vaccine?  Maybe a company can make over the counter test kits and that may make the price of a BIOPHARM stock go up since it mixes with consumerism. 

Any help here would be great, still trying to understand this."	Observations, Questions.	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gg1ag5/observations_questions/

First , they are merging two channels - Kid Genius Cartoon Channel and Baby Genius TV digital platforms  under one new network brand, Kartoon Channel, which will launch on June 15, 2020. 

 The channel will feature programming from Genius Brands‚Äô catalog and from third-party creators, including Warren Buffett‚Äôs Secret Millionaires Club, Thomas Edison‚Äôs Secret Lab, Baby Genius, Martha Stewart &amp; Friends, Stan Lee‚Äôs Mighty 7, Gisele B√ºndchen‚Äôs Gisele &amp; The Green Team, Gummi Bears, Shark Academy, DaJammies, Amber the Ambulance, Dino the Dinosaur, Ethan the Dump Truck, IncrediTales, OneZeez and Super Geek Heroes, among others. 

Me as a parent of 2 kids, hate when they are on youtube because i always give them to watch something smart and they end up with some stupid youtube videos that they got scared of later or want to do stupid things . Parents will love this platform . And it will lunch on their current platforms include Dish, Amazon Prime Video, Sling TV, Comcast‚Äôs Xfinity on Demand, Roku, Apple TV and Apple iOS, Android, Cox, Tubi, and Xumo, with all transitioning into carrying Kartoon Channel. New platforms launching Kartoon Channel content include SelectTV, RedBox, Plex, and Canela Media. 

[DD on this](https://www.mediaplaynews.com/genius-brands-international-to-bow-kartoon-channel-across-digital-platforms-connected-tvs/)

Second  big thing is they are receiving 2.8M today in registered direct offering . That is from  certain long-standing investors . The net proceeds of the financing will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. In addition, Genius Brands intends to use the proceeds to fund production of additional episodes of its series, *Rainbow Rangers*, which will debut on Nick Jr. in conjunction with the launch of the toy line from Mattel, Inc. at Walmart stores Q3 2020

Thats the third big thing that they will have their toys in Walmart begging of Q3 . As early as August .  Additional *Rainbow Rangers* branded products at retail include two DVDs from Distribution Solutions available at Walmart and Target stores nationwide, as well as online at Amazon; costumes and accessories at online retailers, including Walmart, Amazon, Party City and halloweencostumes.com; apparel from Bentex on Amazon; storybooks from Macmillan Publishing at Target.com, Walmart.com, and Barnes &amp; Noble; bicycles from Dynacraft at Walmart.com and Kohl's.com; and stationery items from Inkology on Amazon.¬†

One more thing is if you do search on google for genius brands and click on news you will get over 230k results . Thats not something you are usually getting for penny stocks 

They were at 1.9$ per share 1y ago when they didnt have potential that they have now . I think they will go back to 2$ or over , maybe not being even penny stock anymore in 6 months so , like i said, this is my opinion, im big in this and not selling even if it going down . Will just buy more and bring average cost down ."	$GNUS will be big , IMO over 2$ ..	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gg07rp/gnus_will_be_big_imo_over_2/

CyberTygerFire	1588966473	"""For the past couple of trading sessions, **Microvision, Inc.** (NASDAQ: [MVIS](https://alphastocknews.com/tag/mvis)) has been tumbling in the market. Today, that movement is continuing with the stock down more than 25%. With no news out, many are wondering why the stock is falling.

While there‚Äôs a reason for the declines, they won‚Äôt last long. Moreover, there‚Äôs a strong chance that this company is going to be taken over. So, buying on the declines may be an incredibly strong move. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

## Why MVIS Stock Is Declining

We‚Äôve all heard the old adage, ‚ÄúWhat goes up must come down.‚Äù Well that seems to be the case for Microvision. Late last week and early this week, the stock gained in multiples over the course of a few trading sessions as rumors spread that it would be taken over by Microsoft.

The rumor led to [a short squeeze](https://alphastocknews.com/the-short-squeeze-what-you-need-to-know/1742/), sending the stock through the roof!

However, knowing that most rumors in the market prove to be false, and not hearing anything from MVIS or MSFT, many have lost faith in the idea of a takeover, leading to a bit of a correction in the value of the stock.

Nonetheless, I‚Äôm here to say that if you‚Äôve lost faith, you‚Äôve moved too soon.

## If There Was Ever A True Market Rumor, This Is Likely It

The rumor that we‚Äôre speaking of today surrounds a product called HoloLens, a mixed reality glasses product offered up by Microsoft. However, much of the technology used in the product is owned by MVIS.

As a result, every time someone buys a HoloLens product from Microsoft, they have to turn around and hand royalties to Microvision. Not a bad deal for MVIS right? Well, that‚Äôs not enough to say that an acquisition will happen, but a recent series of events is.

First and foremost, MVIS was having a hard time meeting the demand for specific components of the HoloLens. As a result, the company recently announced that one of its larger companies have taken over component production.

At this point, I was sure it was Microsoft, but the company didn‚Äôt name this mystery customer. Nonetheless, Microsoft had the money, tech, and all capabilities required to streamline component production, and soon enough, it was confirmed in a round about way.

In a press release, the United States Army essentially thanked Microsoft for streamlining the production of these components. Of course, this solidified my view that the mystery partner was indeed Microsoft.

However, the story goes deeper. Recently, we‚Äôve watched as key MVIS employees jump ship and move over to MSFT. In particular, senior researchers have made the move. So, not only is Microsoft helping with production, they are taking some of the company‚Äôs leading employees.

Not to mention, Mcirovision has been dealing with some serious pain lately. As a result, the CEO of the company recently announced that they would be looking into strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to merger and acquisition transactions.

Now, we‚Äôre seeing delays indicative of a deal in the works. The company said that it is not going to hit product and timeline goals that were negotiated under a $100 million deal announced in February. The company also said that it would be delaying an OEM product launch that was expected in 2020.

There are several reasons that these types of delays can happen, but given all of the evidence, the delays, in my opinion, are likely associated with a deal in the works.

When we put two and two together, we get four. In this case, the first two is Microsoft‚Äôs goal to make HoloLens a overwhelmingly popular product and the second is Microvision‚Äôs goal to bring value to investors. When we put those goals together with all of the evidence outlined above, we clearly see that an acquisition is likely on the horizons.

## The Bottom Line

Microsoft has plenty of money to fund this acquisition and they have everything to gain from moving forward with this type of transaction. At the same time, all signs seem to be pointing to a deal in the works. All in all, buying the dip has the potential to yield serious gains if and when a deal does happen.

Crypto:MARA (already spiked big so beware) and RIOT: bitcoin will be all over the news for a few days (the halving!!!! its like y2k for crypto i guess).

Oil: these are like a played out meme from a month ago I guess but earnings are coming and the economy in the US still isn't close to being at full speed - oil storage still needed and NAT already told us that they are making hand over fist cash.  expected to pay a dividend also.  I'm holding NAT

Paper: under the radar cheap buy here.  ITP.  It is a company that makes paper (TP) and facemasks in china.  The price is dirt cheap and China is reopening ahead of us.  I'm going in heavy.

Fileobrother	1588959661	"Be very careful when you see a post after hours Thursday that says ‚ÄúCheck out this sweet stock, it‚Äôs up 30% AH, and look at this DD that *nobody* has seen. 

First of all, the person posting that has almost always bought in at the days low or earlier on in the week. They have much less risk holding that stock going into Friday. 

Second, look at the price. For example, a ton of posts yesterday hyping ZOM. AH, price was mid thirties. Highest it‚Äôs ever been, PB was at like 7, which means it‚Äôs way overvalued. If you did what the post said and bought in at 4am, you probably lost a few bucks this morning when it dropped to .25. 

Now that doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt ever go back to .35. What it does mean is that you‚Äôve now tied up that money into a stock that you can now either sell at a loss or hold until earnings on Monday. Either way, you are at the disadvantage. That poster? He sold this morning PM, I guarantee you that. 

Lastly, consider what day it is. Penny traders typically don‚Äôt hold over the weekend unless there is something special that they got a good price on late in the week.

realaxing	1588954676	"$mark Has now posed itself to be a strong forerunner in an emerging industry. The rapid gain in stock price ( is justified in this case and I'm gonna break down why.

1. Lowering liability. According to their yearly 10-Q for 2018 and 2019, they had reduced overall liability by 61% in this period.
2. Expanse of operations. This year, this company has expanded operations across the entire U.S, into Japan, and numerous places in China. This is important, because now they have a unique product that operates in these three massive mercantile world hubs.
3. Forging of partnerships. Along with geographically expanding, Remark has worked out deals with large malls, Wynn, and potentially other Las Vegas casinos.
4. Filling a new essential role. With rampant fears of coronavirus and other contagions being a new aspect of the normal world until some vaccine is produced, monitoring the temperature of large groups of people simultaneously is a good way of giving people a sense of security against the sickness in public places.
5. Good tech. This company has it's other foot in another emerging market, AI automation. The technology they employ is actually somewhat impressive, having the ability to track faces wearing masks covering half of their faces, count number of people in a group, and track the temperature of each individual simultaneously.

Remark Holdings ($MARK) has set themselves up to succeed in a big way if this trial run with WYNN goes well.

Tbrosen	1588954002	"A lot of the covid stocks are great trading vehicles, and little more. This one may be a good trading vehicle too. What is different is this is also legitimately a potential mult-billion dollar company with a long tail for revenues to continue to explode long after covid is over. 

&amp;#x200B;

What TOMZ offers is a product called Steramist. The technology is quite interesting. Originally created by DARPA to fight anthrax, it takes in a solution containing hydrogen peroxide and using cold plasma arc converts H202 to OH which is a pathogen killing machine. Their equipment¬†¬†creates a fogging mist with a 99.9999% pathogen kill rate and has been registered with the EPA for killing covid. TOMZ now owns the technology.

&amp;#x200B;

Per their press release

 The EPA Emerging Viral Pathogen Guidance for Antimicrobial Pesticides is important because the occurrence of emerging viral pathogens is less common and predictable than established pathogens and **there are currently no other EPA-registered disinfectant product labels with claims against** [**COVID-19**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8uv8vWKa17ghL-Xz4mIubC0AURZuayIGbyMh8ckFFH8u-9WVg80VBAyM77vYKmi1mOEaLaZ5ehEC4kzhTy9x1VAECkBem3xkaL81HYwwFNUDAtDBhjXRVgT1c9iSvxpVM6zsbhpPpbLfe9StuHxQoA==)**.**¬†¬†

[http://investor.tomimist.com/prviewer/release\_only/id/4264471](http://investor.tomimist.com/prviewer/release_only/id/4264471)

&amp;#x200B;

Revenues have exploded. They recently announced that solution sales are up 1000% over last year. 

[http://investor.tomimist.com/prviewer/release\_only/id/4306182](http://investor.tomimist.com/prviewer/release_only/id/4306182)

&amp;#x200B;

Part of what is exciting here is this is a blade and razor model with very high margins. The solution sales continue for as long as people are disinfecting, and where TOMZ is different is that the paranoia about covid and other diseases is not likely to go away. This is the new normal and theaters, airplanes, playgrounds, doctors offices, hospitals, cruise ships and others are going to need to change going forward to reassure the public that they have a safe non-toxic way to keep them healthy and safe from diseases. Steramist does exactly that. Not only does it kill pathogens, but it degrades to just humidity in a matter of minutes. There is no toxic residue, unlike some of the harsh chemicals used in hospitals today, and is completely safe around the most sensitive electronics. I think demand will be forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the questions is do we hit critical mass. To become a multi-billion dollar company Steramist will have to become the standard. There is plenty of evidence of uptake.

&amp;#x200B;

For example CVS is now using Steramist in their 10,000 or so pharmacies as part of their disinfectant protocol. 

[http://investor.tomimist.com/prviewer/release\_only/id/4268534](http://investor.tomimist.com/prviewer/release_only/id/4268534)

&amp;#x200B;

The South Korean public transit system is also using Steramist

[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-03-02/tomi-environmental-solutions-inc-steramist-declared-official-decontamination-technology-of-seoul-city-metropolitan-transit](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-03-02/tomi-environmental-solutions-inc-steramist-declared-official-decontamination-technology-of-seoul-city-metropolitan-transit)

&amp;#x200B;

They have also indicated that steramist is now the standard decontamination technology in China. That is a bit vague so you have to take it with a slight grain of salt but you can imagine what it would mean for revenue if this was a standard throughout China.

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tomi-receives-china-cdc-registration-making-steramist-the-disinfection-industry-standard-in-china-1028872572?op=1](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tomi-receives-china-cdc-registration-making-steramist-the-disinfection-industry-standard-in-china-1028872572?op=1)

&amp;#x200B;

The technology is also being used to sterilize first responder vehicles and playgrounds.

[https://www.newsherald.com/news/20200414/coronavirus-florida-panama-city-parks-get-disinfected-daily-promote-outdoor-play](https://www.newsherald.com/news/20200414/coronavirus-florida-panama-city-parks-get-disinfected-daily-promote-outdoor-play)

&amp;#x200B;

 It just seems fairly obvious why spending 10 minutes to spray an area at the end of the business day with no toxic chemicals could be something every business does and their technology is patented making them a single source player. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now there are competing technologies out there so it isn't as if TOMZ is going to have a corner on disinfectants, but their technology does have a few important advantages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other options include hydrogen peroxide spray solutions, but they lack the cold arc technology that converts H202 to OH meaning they lack the killing power of Steramist.

&amp;#x200B;

UV light is another approach, but has a couple of disadvantages. Possibly most importantly is that UV light can't reach areas not directly exposed to light like crevices and areas behind furniture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The company announced that they sold out nearly all of their inventory in Q1 and have an enormous backlog of machines on order. Keep in mind a machine sale now is revenue for years to come and margins are close to 60%. There are markets here for both their handheld systems and large hvac systems to disinfect entire buildings. 

&amp;#x200B;

We can expect a big Q1 to be announced in a matter of days with revenues likely up several hundred percent over last year, and with profitability. I'm looking forward to that and to announcements of more use in more places going forward. It just makes sense. There are about 150 million diluted shares outstanding and insiders own about 25% of those shares. After a recent conversion of a note the balance sheet is also respectable. I think we could have a multi-bagger in the near term and a many bagger in the long term. The world has changed and TOMZ can be a huge part of that.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: TOMZ is a potential billion dollar company with a monopoly on a sterilization technology that is poised to become the defacto standard for killing covid and other pathogens in businesses, public transit, playgrounds, first responder vehicles, and cruise ships. They are seeing explosive revenue growth and wide adaptation due to their superior technology and a changing paranoid world that will demand safety from viruses for the forseeable future."

ravya1	1588949391	"I'm watching KTOV closely for the following reasons:

* FDA approval for marketing a treatment for osteoarthritic pain and hypertension (drug is called Consensi)
   * Will hit market in Q2
   * They partnered with S.Korea, US, and China (huge markets)
* 2 other drugs are in the pre-clinical and Phase I clinical trials for cancer drugs
*Their cash on hand is much higher than their liabilities
* Avg vol (10 day)/Avg vol (3 month) = 3.8
   * Lots of attention recently
* $10M public offering to purchase 25M shares at a price of $0.40 (expires today)
   * If closes above $0.40 EOD today, massive purchase order ""should"" be executed and pump the price
      * Only risk if this is a shorting style of play
* 17.75% of shares are institutionally owned, lots of big boys believe in it
* Market Cap of $26.8M which will drastically reduce if the public offering is executed
* 52 Week high of $1.12


Overall I see possibility of a solid investment in the long term, especially given they have a physical drug hitting the market in Q2 with interest from two G7 countries. Not to say South Korea isn't a powerhouse of an economy either. Add into this the low debt, high cash on hand and they are well poised to weather any delay in their other drugs in clinical trials.

Short term pump is possible with the public offering and the increasing volume in the past 10 days.

The way I see it, there is a risk in the short term, however, long term growth seems well for the remainder of 2020.

We are currently above .40 with great support at .42. Likely that order will be executed today, hop on the moon ship before it is too late.

I'm not saying to sell or whatever, but i wouldn't hold long on this. It will rise, but I've set a trail sell limit at 10% dip. Good news are being circulated, and I've watched this stock since 3 months ago, so I'm a little surpised how much info popped up when the stock is on the rise.  I'm not complaining, just saying. I'll take your downvotes if you only wish for good news. This is the 3rd UAVS or thr 2nd MVIS for me, i lost uavs but gained mvis, so I'm not complaining. Just fyi, i bought all 3 stocks before there were hypes.

Here is one that is gaining traction that you should have some love for: TTI. There's more meat on this bone compared to Ktov, so if you had to choose between the two, i would recommend TTI.

Both will gain 17% to 20% this coming week, so make your gains and don't get bullied or trapped into bag holding.

End rant and cautionary tale. Please share your thoughts on these stocks:

1. Dffn
2. Phun
3. Ktov
4. Tti
5. Mara
6. Fet
7. Nxtd
8. Csu
9. Tops (I'll skip SHIP)
10. Nbrv

Cumulatively, I'm holding over 20k in all the 10 stocks above. My goal isn't to the moon, maybe to the top of Everest. 20 to 25% gain and I'm out. My personal belief is penny stocks are pennystocks for a reason, they are trash. But, once in a while, trash can be made into cash if one knows when to enter and exit.

Good luck and happy weekend. Ktov and tti for the win!"	KTOV and TTI	https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gg7jo3/ktov_and_tti/

Doing some DD I found MVIS has worked with manufacturer STMicroelectronics. I found this post from 11/16

The key paragraph in this post

‚ÄúTeaming up with ST, a world leader in its field, is important for MicroVision both for ST‚Äôs expertise in semiconductor technology and its global customer reach,‚Äù said Alexander Tokman, president and CEO of MicroVision. ‚ÄúCombining ST‚Äôs expertise in the development and manufacture of key components for LBS scanning engines with MicroVision‚Äôs proprietary system, engine, and applications knowledge, and intellectual property can be highly advantageous for marketing LBS solutions to a wide array of companies for numerous applications.‚Äù¬†

Flynn402	1589301156	" Hey covered some recent news that surfaced again that is showing a better chance that MSFT may buy MVIS or partially purchase just the hololens company. I attached a partial script of the video and added a link to the full video. 

[https://youtu.be/\_2ANzCtKysE](https://youtu.be/_2ANzCtKysE)

Partial Script: Today I wanted to cover MVIS again. On friday the company reported its quarterly results on friday. The reports revealed the company is struggling financially but has been trending up since the Friday report was released. The reason for its rise in price is because MVIS has been considered too big to fail for Microsoft. Rumors are swirling more now than ever that there's a strong change that MVIS and MSFT will be conducting a transaction very soon. In the recent conference call MVIS mentioned the word ‚Äúacquisition‚Äù many times. Over the past few months MVIS has been struggling. MVIS is currently trading for $1.14 per share and has a market cap of 162.51 million. It's taken multiple attempts to increase its financial runway by cutting its workforce by 60%.
